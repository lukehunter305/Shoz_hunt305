        <div class="question">Q1. What is Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a widely used language for developing applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q2. What are the features of Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Key features of Java include platform independence, object-orientation, security, robustness, simplicity, multithreading support, and garbage collection.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q3. What is JVM and why is it important?</div>
        <div class="answer">JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, which is the part of the Java Runtime Environment that executes Java byte code. It is important because it provides a platform-independent way of executing Java code.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q4. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</div>
        <div class="answer">JDK (Java Development Kit) is the full software development kit required to develop Java applications, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a subset of JDK that is required to run Java applications, and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the component of JRE that executes Java bytecode.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q5. What is the use of the public static void main(String[] args) method?</div>
        <div class="answer">This method is the entry point for any Java application. It is the method called by the JVM to run the program.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q6. Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes) and code in the form of procedures (methods). Java uses OOP principles including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q7. What is inheritance in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept where one class can inherit fields and methods from another class. In Java, inheritance is achieved using the extends keyword.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q8. What is polymorphism in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Polymorphism in Java is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q9. Explain encapsulation with an example in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">Encapsulation in Java is the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This is usually done by making fields private and providing public getter and setter methods.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q10. What is an interface in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">An interface in Java is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Interfaces cannot contain instance fields. The methods in interfaces are abstract by default.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q11. Explain the concept of an abstract class.</div>
        <div class="answer">An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods, which do not have an implementation and must be implemented in subclasses.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q12. What are constructors in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Constructors in Java are special methods used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created and has the same name as the class.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q13. What is method overloading?</div>
        <div class="answer">Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their parameter lists are different. It is a way of implementing compile-time polymorphism.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q14. What is method overriding?</div>
        <div class="answer">Method overriding, in Java, is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q15. What is a package in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Java, a package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually, packages are similar to different folders on your computer.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q16. Explain the final keyword in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">The final keyword in Java can be used to mark a variable as constant (not changeable), a method as not overrideable, or a class as not inheritable.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q17. What are Java Exceptions?</div>
        <div class="answer">Exceptions in Java are events that disrupt the normal flow of the program. They are objects that wrap an error event that occurred within a method and are either caught or propagated further up the calling chain.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q18. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?</div>
        <div class="answer">Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked at compile-time, meaning that the code must handle or declare them. Unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime, meaning they can be thrown without being caught or declared.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q19. What is the static keyword used for in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">The static keyword in Java is used to indicate that a particular field, method, or block of code belongs to the class, rather than instances of the class. Static members are shared among all instances of a class.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q20. What is a thread in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">A thread in Java is a lightweight process that allows concurrent execution of code. Java provides built-in support for multithreading using the Thread class and Runnable interface.</div>
        
    
    <div class="question">Q21. What is the difference between == and .equals()?</div>
        <div class="answer">The == operator compares memory addresses, while the .equals() method checks for value equality in objects.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q22. What is garbage collection in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Garbage collection in Java is an automatic memory management process that removes unused objects to free up memory. The JVM performs garbage collection to avoid memory leaks.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q23. What is the Collections Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">The Collections Framework in Java is a set of classes and interfaces that provide data structures like Lists, Sets, and Maps for handling collections of objects.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q24. Explain the synchronized keyword.</div>
        <div class="answer">The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control access to critical sections of code by multiple threads, preventing race conditions.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q25. What are generics in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Generics allow the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods with type parameters to provide type safety and code reusability.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q26. What is the this keyword in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">The this keyword in Java refers to the current instance of a class and is used to access instance variables and methods.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q27. What is an Enum in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">An Enum in Java is a special data type that defines a fixed set of constants.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q28. What is multithreading in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Multithreading in Java allows multiple threads to run simultaneously, improving efficiency and performance.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q29. Explain the volatile keyword in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">The volatile keyword ensures that a variable is read directly from memory rather than from a thread's local cache, ensuring visibility across multiple threads.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q30. Explain volatile keyword in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. Declaring a variable volatile ensures that its value is read from the main memory and not from the thread's cache memory.</div>

        <h2>Java Architecture and Memory Management</h2>
        
      <div class="question">Q1. Is Java 100% object-oriented programming language?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, Java is not considered 100% object-oriented because it uses primitive types (like int, char, etc.) that are not objects.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q2. What are the advantages of Java being partially object-oriented?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Using simple, non-object types like integers and booleans helps Java run faster and use less memory.</li>
                <li>The mix of features allows Java to work well with other technologies and systems, which might not be fully object-oriented.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q3. What is the use of object-oriented programming languages in enterprise projects?</div>
        <div class="answer">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is used in big projects to make coding easier to handle. It helps organize code better, makes it easier to update and scale, and lets programmers reuse code, saving time and effort.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q4. Explain public static void main(String args[])?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Java, public static void main(String[] args) is the entry point of any standalone Java application.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q5. What will happen if we don’t declare the main method as static?</div>
        <div class="answer">If the main method is not declared as static, the JVM will not be able to launch the application.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q6. Can we override the main method?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, the main method cannot be overridden because it is a static method.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q7. Can JVM execute our overloaded main method?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, JVM only calls the original main method and does not execute overloaded versions.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q8. What’s the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?</div>
        <div class="answer">Primitive data types are predefined and not objects, while non-primitive data types are objects and can call methods.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q9. Can primitive data types be NULL?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, primitive data types cannot be null. They have default values.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q10. Can we declare pointers in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, Java does not support pointers for security reasons.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q11. What are wrapper classes?</div>
        <div class="answer">Wrapper classes allow primitive data types to be treated as objects. Examples include Integer, Double, etc.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q12. Why do we need wrapper classes?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>They provide methods like valueOf() and parseInt().</li>
                <li>They enable autoboxing and unboxing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q13. Why do we use wrapper classes in collections?</div>
        <div class="answer">Java collections can only store objects, so wrapper classes allow primitives to be stored in collections.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q14. What is the difference between unboxing and autoboxing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Autoboxing converts a primitive to a wrapper object, while unboxing converts a wrapper object back to a primitive.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q15. Can autoboxing cause unexpected behavior?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, comparing two Integer objects using == might give unexpected results for values outside the range of -128 to 127.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q16. Can autoboxing and unboxing cause a NullPointerException?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, if a null object is unboxed, a NullPointerException will occur.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q17. What is the role of try, catch, and finally in exception handling?</div>
        <div class="answer">The try block contains risky code, catch handles exceptions, and finally executes cleanup code.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q18. What happens if return is used inside try or catch?</div>
        <div class="answer">The finally block still executes before returning the value.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q19. Can we use try with finally without a catch block?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, a try block can be used with finally without a catch block to ensure cleanup occurs.</div>
		 <div class="question">Q20. How does exception handling with try-catch-finally affect the performance of a Java application?</div>
        <div class="answer">Using try-catch-finally can affect performance slightly due to the overhead of managing exceptions but is generally minimal unless exceptions are thrown frequently.</div>

        <div class="question">Q21. Can you tell me a condition where the finally block will not be executed?</div>
        <div class="answer">The finally block will not execute if the JVM exits via System.exit() during try or catch execution.</div>

        <div class="question">Q22. Can we write multiple finally blocks in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, each try can only have one finally block. Multiple finally blocks are not allowed within a single try-catch-finally structure.</div>

        <div class="question">Q23. What is an exception and the differences between checked and unchecked exceptions?</div>
        <div class="answer">An exception is an unwanted event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the flow. Checked exceptions must be declared or handled (e.g., IOException), whereas unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared or caught (e.g., NullPointerException).</div>

        <div class="question">Q24. How would you handle multiple exceptions in a single catch block?</div>
        <div class="answer">Use a single catch block for multiple exceptions by separating them with a pipe (|), e.g., catch (IOException | SQLException e), to handle both exceptions with the same logic.</div>

        <div class="question">Q25. What is the difference between a Throwable and an Exception in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Throwable is the superclass for all errors and exceptions. Exception is a subclass of Throwable representing recoverable conditions, while Error (another subclass) represents serious issues the application should not attempt to recover from.</div>

        <div class="question">Q26. Discuss the difference between finalize() and finally. Under what circumstances might finalize() not get called in a Java application?</div>
        <div class="answer">finalize() is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed, while finally is used in a try-catch block to execute code regardless of exceptions. finalize() may not get called if the garbage collector doesn't run or the JVM shuts down.</div>

        <div class="question">Q27. What is the string pool?</div>
        <div class="answer">A Java String Pool is a place in heap memory where all the strings defined in the program are stored. Whenever a new string object is created, the JVM checks for its presence in the String pool. If the String is available in the pool, the same object reference is shared; otherwise, a new object is created.</div>

        <div class="question">Q28. Are there any scenarios where using the string pool might not be beneficial?</div>
        <div class="answer">It will not be beneficial when there are a lot of unique strings because it will be complex to check each string.</div>

        <div class="question">Q29. Can you please tell me about String and StringBuffer?</div>
        <div class="answer">String in Java is immutable, meaning once created, its value cannot be changed. StringBuffer is mutable, allowing for modification of its contents, and is thread-safe, making it suitable for use in multithreaded environments where strings need to be altered.</div>

        <div class="question">Q30. How does StringBuilder differ from StringBuffer, and when should each be used?</div>
        <div class="answer">StringBuilder is similar to StringBuffer but is not thread-safe, making it faster for single-threaded scenarios.</div>

        <div class="question">Q31. Give a scenario where StringBuffer is better than String.</div>
        <div class="answer">A scenario where StringBuffer is more appropriate than String is in a multi-threaded server application where multiple threads modify a shared string, such as constructing a complex log entry concurrently from different threads.</div>

        <div class="question">Q32. What is the difference between a String literal and a String object?</div>
        <div class="answer">A String literal is stored in the String pool for reusability. A String object, created using new String(), is stored in the heap, even if it has the same value as a literal.</div>

        <div class="question">Q33. Why is String immutable?</div>
        <div class="answer">String is immutable to improve security, caching, and performance by ensuring that its value cannot be changed once created.</div>

        <div class="question">Q34. What are the packages in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Java, packages are namespaces that organize classes and interfaces into groups, preventing naming conflicts and managing access control. They provide a structured way to manage Java code, allowing related classes to be grouped together logically.</div>

        <div class="question">Q35. Why are packages used?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            1. They help in organizing code.<br>
            2. Packages prevent naming conflicts by providing a unique namespace.<br>
            3. Packages support modularity by allowing developers to separate the program.<br>
            4. Organizing classes into packages makes it easier to locate related classes.</div>


<h2>Object Oriented Programming Concepts</h2>
<div class="question">Q1. What are access modifiers in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Java uses public, protected, default (no modifier), and private to control access to classes, methods, and fields, ensuring appropriate visibility and encapsulation.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q2. Can you provide examples of when to use each type of access modifier?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            1. <b>Public:</b> Used when members should be accessible from any other class.<br>
            2. <b>Protected:</b> Ideal for members that should be accessible to subclasses and classes within the same package.<br>
            3. <b>Default:</b> Use when members should be accessible only within the same package.<br>
            4. <b>Private:</b> Best for members intended only for use within their own class.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q3. Why do we use getters and setters when we can make fields public and set/get directly?</div>
        <div class="answer">Using getters and setters instead of public variables allows us to control how values are set and accessed, add validation, and keep the ability to change how data is stored without affecting other parts of your program.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q4. Can a top-level class be private or protected in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, a top-level class cannot be private or protected because it restricts access, making it unusable from any other classes, contrary to the purpose of a top-level class.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q5. Explain the concepts of classes and objects in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">Classes are blueprints for objects in Java, defining the state and behavior that the objects of the class can have. Objects are instances of classes, representing entities with states and behaviors defined by their class.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q6. What are the ways to create an object?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            1. Using the <b>new</b> Keyword, example: <code>MyClass object = new MyClass();</code><br>
            2. Using <b>Class Factory Methods</b>, example: <code>Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();</code><br>
            3. Using the <b>clone()</b> method.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q7. Can a class in Java be without any methods or fields?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, a class in Java can be declared without any methods or fields. Such a class can still be used to create objects, although these objects would have no specific behavior or state.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q8. What are the methods available in the Object class, and how are they used?</div>
        <div class="answer">The key methods are <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code>, <code>toString()</code>, <code>clone()</code>, <code>finalize()</code>, <code>wait()</code>, <code>notify()</code>, and <code>notifyAll()</code>. These provide basic operations like equality checks, memory management, and thread coordination.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q9. What are anonymous classes and their advantages?</div>
        <div class="answer">Anonymous classes in Java are classes without a name, defined and instantiated in one place. They are useful when you need to create a subclass or implement an interface for a one-time use. The advantages include reduced boilerplate code, encapsulation of specific functionality, and the ability to override methods on the fly.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q10. What is a Singleton Class?</div>
        <div class="answer">A singleton class in Java is a special class that can have only one instance (or object) at any time. It's useful when we want to make sure there's just one shared resource, like a configuration setting or a connection to a database.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q11. How can we create a Singleton class?</div>
        <div class="answer">To create a singleton class, make the constructor private, create a private static instance of the class, and provide a static method to return the instance.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q12. Are singleton classes thread-safe?</div>
        <div class="answer">Singleton classes are not thread-safe by default. If multiple threads try to create an instance at the same time, it could result in multiple instances. To prevent this, we can synchronize the method that creates the instance or use a static initializer.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q13. What is a constructor in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize new objects. It has the same name as the class and may take arguments to set initial values for the object's attributes.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q14. Can we use a private constructor?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we can use private constructors in Java. They are mostly used in classes that provide static methods or contain only static fields. A common use is in the Singleton design pattern.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q15. Can a constructor be overloaded?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, you can have multiple constructors in a Java class, each with a different set of parameters. This lets you create objects in various ways depending on what information you have at the time.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q16. What does immutability mean in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Immutability in Java means that once an object's state is created, it cannot be changed.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q17. Why are immutable objects useful for concurrent programming?</div>
        <div class="answer">Immutable objects are useful in concurrent programming because they can be shared between threads without needing synchronization.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q18. What are immutable classes?</div>
        <div class="answer">Immutable classes in Java are classes whose objects cannot be modified after they are created. This means all their fields are final and set only once, typically through the constructor.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q19. How can we create an immutable class?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            1. Declare the class as <b>final</b> so it can't be extended.<br>
            2. Make all of the fields <b>final</b> and <b>private</b> so that direct access is not allowed.<br>
            3. Don’t provide setter methods for variables.<br>
            4. Initialize all fields using a constructor.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q20. What does Java's inheritance mean?</div>
        <div class="answer">Inheritance in Java means a class can use the features of another class. This helps to reuse code and make things simpler.</div>
     <div class="question">Q21. Can a class extend on its own?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, a class in Java cannot extend itself. If it tries, it will cause an error.</div>

        <div class="question">Q22. Why multiple inheritance is not possible in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Java avoids using multiple inheritance because it can make things complicated, such as when two parent classes have methods that conflict.</div>

        <div class="question">Q23. What is the difference between inheritance and composition?</div>
        <div class="answer">Inheritance is when one class gets its features from another class. Composition is when a class is made using parts from other classes, which can be more flexible.</div>

        <div class="question">Q24. Discuss the principle of "composition over inheritance". Provide an example where this principle should be applied in Java application design.</div>
        <div class="answer">"Composition over inheritance" means using objects within other objects (composition) instead of inheriting from a parent class. It’s applied when classes have a "has-a" relationship. For example, a Car class can have an Engine class as a field rather than inheriting from an Engine.</div>

        <div class="question">Q25. What is the difference between association, aggregation, and composition in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Association is a general relationship between two classes. Aggregation is a weak association (has-a) where the child can exist independently of the parent. Composition is a strong association where the child cannot exist without the parent.</div>

        <div class="question">Q26. Explain the IS-A (inheritance) and Has-A (composition) relationships in Java.</div>
        <div class="answer">IS-A refers to inheritance, where a subclass is a type of the superclass. Has-A refers to composition, where a class contains references to other classes as fields.</div>

        <div class="question">Q27. What does polymorphism mean in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Polymorphism in Java means that the same piece of code can do different things depending on what kind of object it's dealing with. For example, if you have a method called "draw," it might make a circle for a Circle object and a square for a Square object.</div>

        <div class="question">Q28. How does method overloading relate to polymorphism?</div>
        <div class="answer">Method overloading is using the same method name with different inputs in the same class. It's a simple way to use polymorphism when you're writing your code.</div>

        <div class="question">Q29. What is dynamic method dispatch in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Dynamic method dispatch is a way Java decides which method to use at runtime when methods are overridden in subclasses. It ensures the correct method is used based on the type of object.</div>

        <div class="question">Q30. Can constructors be polymorphic?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, constructors cannot be polymorphic. We can have many constructors in a class with different inputs, but they don’t behave differently based on the object type like methods do.</div>
   <div class="question">Q31. What does abstraction mean in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Abstraction in Java means focusing on what needs to be done, not how to do it. You create a kind of blueprint that tells other parts of the program what actions they can perform without explaining the details.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q32. Can you provide examples of where abstraction is effectively used in Java libraries?</div>
        <div class="answer">Java uses abstraction in its collection tools. For example, when you use a List, you don't need to know how it stores data, whether as an ArrayList or a LinkedList.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q33. What happens if a class includes an abstract method?</div>
        <div class="answer">A class with an abstract method must itself be abstract. We can't create objects directly from an abstract class; it's meant to be a blueprint for other classes.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q34. How does abstraction help in achieving loose coupling in software applications?</div>
        <div class="answer">Abstraction lets us hide complex details and only show what's necessary. This makes it easier to change parts of your program without affecting others, keeping different parts independent and easier to manage.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q35. What is an interface in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">An interface is like a blueprint for a class. It defines a set of methods that the class must implement, without specifying how these methods should work.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q36. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">An abstract class achieves partial abstraction (0 to 100%), whereas an interface achieves full abstraction. An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods, whereas an interface can have only abstract methods. (Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.)</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q37. Can you provide examples of when to use an interface versus when to extend a class?</div>
        <div class="answer">Use an interface when we want to list the methods a class should have, without detailing how they work. Use class extension when we want a new class to inherit features and behaviors from an existing class and possibly modify them.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q38. How do you use multiple inheritance in Java using interfaces?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Java, we can't inherit features from multiple classes directly, but we can use interfaces for a similar effect. A class can follow the guidelines of many interfaces at once, which lets it combine many sets of capabilities.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q39. Can an interface in Java contain static methods, and if so, how can they be used?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, interfaces in Java can have static methods, which you can use without creating an instance of the class.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q40. When would you use an interface, and when would you use an abstract class?</div>
        <div class="answer">Use an interface when you need multiple classes to share a contract without implementation. Use an abstract class when you need shared behavior (method implementations) along with method declarations.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q41. Explain the difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces. When would you use one over the other?</div>
        <div class="answer">Comparable is used for natural ordering and is implemented by the class itself, while Comparator is used for custom ordering and can be implemented externally. Use Comparable when objects have a single logical ordering; use Comparator when you need multiple ways to order objects.</div>
     <div class="question">Q41. What is a static method in an Interface, and how is it different from a default method in an interface?</div>
    <div class="answer">A static method in an interface belongs to the interface itself and cannot be overridden. A default method provides a default implementation for classes that implement the interface, and it can be overridden.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q42. What is the diamond problem in Java and how does Java address it?</div>
    <div class="answer">The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance where a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor. Java resolves this by not allowing multiple inheritance with classes, but interfaces can use default methods to avoid this issue.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q43. How does the concept of default methods in interfaces help resolve the diamond problem?</div>
    <div class="answer">Default methods allow interfaces to provide method implementations, and in case of conflicts (multiple interfaces with the same default method), the implementing class must override the method, resolving ambiguity.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q44. What does mean by encapsulation in java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Encapsulation in Java is like putting important information into a safe. We store data and the methods inside a class, and we control who can access or change the data by using specific methods.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q45. How Encapsulation Enhances Software Security and Integrity:</div>
    <div class="answer">Encapsulation keeps important data hidden and safe. It only lets certain parts of our program use this data, which helps prevent mistakes and keeps the data secure from unwanted changes.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q46. What is the concept of Serialization in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission. It allows objects to be saved and restored later or transferred over a network.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q47. What is the purpose of the serialVersionUID in Java serialization?</div>
    <div class="answer">The serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for Serializable classes. It ensures that the serialized and deserialized objects are compatible by checking version consistency. If the serialVersionUID of the class doesn’t match during deserialization, an InvalidClassException is thrown, preventing incompatible class versions from being used.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q48. What happens if the serialVersionUID of a class changes during deserialization?</div>
    <div class="answer">If the serialVersionUID changes between serialization and deserialization, the JVM considers the class as incompatible with the serialized object. This results in an InvalidClassException, as the runtime expects the version of the serialized class to match with the version defined in the deserialized class.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q49. How can you prevent certain fields from being serialized in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">You can prevent specific fields from being serialized by marking them with the transient keyword. When a field is declared as transient, it is excluded from the serialization process, meaning its value will not be saved when the object is serialized.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q50. Can a class be serialized if one of its member fields is not serializable?</div>
    <div class="answer">A class can still be serialized even if one of its member fields is not serializable. However, you must mark the non-serializable field as transient. If the field is not transient and is not serializable, attempting to serialize the object will result in a NotSerializableException.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q51. What is the difference between writeObject() and readObject() methods in Java serialization?</div>
    <div class="answer">The writeObject() and readObject() methods allow customization of the serialization and deserialization processes. writeObject() is used to customize how an object is serialized, while readObject() customizes how it is deserialized. These methods can be overridden to handle complex scenarios, such as serializing transient fields or managing class versioning.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q52. Is it possible to serialize static fields in Java? Why or why not?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, static fields are not serialized in Java because they belong to the class, not to individual instances. Serialization is intended to capture the state of an object, and static fields are part of the class's state, not the object's state.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q53. How do you serialize an object with circular references in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java handles circular references during serialization by keeping track of references that have already been serialized. When the same object reference appears again, Java writes a reference to the already serialized object rather than serializing it again. This prevents infinite recursion and maintains the object graph structure.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q54. What is method overloading in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters. It provides flexibility by enabling multiple ways to call a method with different arguments.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q55. How does the Java compiler determine which overloaded method to call?</div>
    <div class="answer">When we call an overloaded method, the Java compiler looks at the number and type of arguments provided and picks the method that matches these arguments best.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q56. Is it possible to overload methods that differ only by their return type in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, we cannot overload methods just by changing their return type. The methods must differ by their parameters for overloading to be valid.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q57. What are the rules for method overloading in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The parameters must differ in how many there are, what type they are, or the order they are in.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q58. What is method overriding in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">To override a method, the new method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class. Also, the new method should not be less accessible than the original.</div>
<div class="question">Q58. What is method overriding in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">To override a method, the new method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class. Also, the new method should not be less accessible than the original.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q59. What are the rules and conditions for method overriding in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, method overriding occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as one in its parent class. The method in the subclass replaces the one in the parent class when called.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q60. How does the @Override annotation influence method overriding?</div>
    <div class="answer">The @Override annotation tells the compiler that the method is supposed to replace one from its superclass. It's useful because it helps find mistakes if the method does not actually override an existing method from the parent class.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q61. What happens if a superclass method is overridden by more than one subclass in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">If different subclasses override the same method from a superclass, each subclass will have its own version of that method.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q62. What is 'this' and 'super' keyword in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">'this' is used to refer current class's instance as well as static members. 'super' keyword is used to access methods of the parent class.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q63. Can 'this' keyword be assigned a new value in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, this keyword cannot be assigned a new value in Java. It is a read-only reference that always points to the current object.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q64. What happens if you attempt to use the "super" keyword in a class that doesn't have a superclass?</div>
    <div class="answer">If we attempt to use the "super" keyword in a class that doesn't have a superclass, a compilation error occurs. The "super" keyword is only applicable within subclasses to refer to members of the superclass.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q65. Can the this or super keyword be used in a static method?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, the this and super keyword cannot be used in static methods. Static methods belong to the class, not instances, and super refers to the superclass's object context, which does not exist in a static context.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q66. How does 'super' play a role in polymorphism?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, the super keyword lets a subclass use methods from its parent class, helping it behave in different ways and that is nothing but a polymorphic behavior.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q67. What is the static keyword in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The static keyword in Java is used to indicate that a particular member (variable or method) belongs to the class, rather than any instance of the class. This means that the static member can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q68. Can a static block throw an exception?</div>
    <div class="answer">Yes, a static block can throw an exception, but if it does, the exception must be handled within the block itself or declared using a throws clause in the class.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q69. Can we override static methods in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at runtime and static methods are bound at compile time.</div>
   
   <div class="question">Q70. Is it possible to access non-static members from within a static method?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, it's not possible to access non-static members (instance variables or methods) directly from within a static method. This is because static methods belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance. To access non-static members, you need to create an instance of the class and use that object to reference the non-static members.</div>
	<div class="question">Q71. What is static block?</div>
    <div class="answer">To initialize static variables, the statements inside static block are executed only once, when the class is loaded in the memory.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q72. Can we print something on console without main method in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Prior to Java 8, yes, we can print something without main method but it's not possible from Java 8 onwards.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q73. What is final keyword in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The 'final' keyword is used to declare constants, making variables unchangeable once assigned, or to prevent method overriding or class inheritance.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q74. What are some common use cases for using final variables in Java programming?</div>
    <div class="answer">Common use cases for using final variables in Java programming include defining constants, parameters passed to methods, and local variables in lambdas or anonymous inner classes.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q75. How does the "final" keyword contribute to immutability and thread safety in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The "final" keyword contributes to immutability and thread safety in Java by ensuring that the value of a variable cannot be changed once assigned, preventing unintended modifications and potential concurrency issues.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q76. Can you describe any performance considerations related to using final?</div>
    <div class="answer">The final keyword improves the performance by reducing call overhead.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q77. What is a functional interface?</div>
    <div class="answer">Functional interfaces in Java are interfaces with just one abstract method. They are used to create lambda expressions, and instances of these interfaces can be created with lambdas, method references, or constructor references.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q78. Can a functional interface extend another interface?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, as a functional interface allows only a single abstract method. However, a functional interface can inherit another interface if it contains only static and default methods.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q79. Advantages of using a functional interface.</div>
    <div class="answer">Functional interfaces, which contain only one abstract method, are key to enabling functional programming in Java. They offer concise and readable code through lambda expressions and method references, improving code simplicity. Functional interfaces allow easy parallel processing, better abstraction, and reusability, especially in scenarios like streams and event handling, promoting a cleaner and more expressive programming style.</div>


<h2>Java 8 basics</h2>

 <div class="question">Q1. Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">Lambda Expressions, Stream API, Method References, Default Methods, Optional Class, New Date-Time API are the new features that were introduced in Java 8.</div>

    <div class="question">Q2. Why optional class, lambda expressions, and stream API were introduced in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">Optional class was introduced in Java 8 as a way to address the problem of null references. Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 to make it easier to write code for interfaces that have only one method, using a simpler and more direct style. The Stream API was introduced in Java 8 to help developers process collections of data in a more straightforward and efficient way, especially for bulk operations like filtering or sorting.</div>

    <div class="question">Q3. Difference between filter and map function of Stream API?</div>
    <div class="answer">filter() eliminates elements of a collection where the condition is not satisfied, whereas map() is used to perform an operation on all elements; hence, it returns all elements of the collection.</div>

    <div class="question">Q4. Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 11?</div>
    <div class="answer">HTTP Client, Epsilon Garbage Collector, Z Garbage Collector, Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters are some of the new features. Additionally, methods like isBlank(), strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(), and repeat() were introduced for strings.</div>

    <div class="question">Q5. Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 17?</div>
    <div class="answer">Sealed Classes, Pattern Matching for switch, and the Foreign Function and Memory API are some examples.</div>

    <div class="question">Q6. Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 21?</div>
    <div class="answer">Virtual Threads, Structured Concurrency, Scoped Values, Sequenced Collections, and Record Pattern are some examples.</div>

    <div class="question">Q7. Which is faster, traditional for loop or Streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">Traditional for loops are generally faster due to less overhead, but Streams provide better readability and are optimized for parallel processing in large datasets.</div>

    <div class="question">Q8. In which scenarios would you prefer traditional for loops and streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">Use traditional loops for simple, small datasets requiring maximum performance. Use Streams for more complex data transformations or when working with large datasets where readability, maintainability, and potential parallelism are prioritized.</div>

    <div class="question">Q9. Explain intermediate and terminal operations in Streams.</div>
    <div class="answer">Intermediate operations (e.g., filter(), map()) return another stream and are lazy (executed only when a terminal operation is called). Terminal operations (e.g., forEach(), collect()) trigger the actual processing of the stream and produce a result or side effect.</div>

    <div class="question">Q10. Differences in Interface from Java 7 to Java 8.</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 7, interfaces could only have abstract methods. Java 8 introduced default and static methods, allowing interfaces to have method implementations.</div>

    <div class="question">Q11. Use of String.join(….) in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">String.join() concatenates a sequence of strings with a specified delimiter, simplifying string joining operations.</div>

<h2>Java 8 advance</h2>

 <div class="question">Q1. What are the new features introduced in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java 8 introduced several significant features that enhanced the language's capabilities and performance. Key additions include Lambda Expressions for concise and functional-style programming, the Stream API for efficient data processing, and the new Date and Time API for improved date handling. Java 8 also introduced default and static methods in interfaces, allowing more complex interface designs, and the Optional class to better handle null values. These features collectively made Java more flexible and powerful, especially for handling collections and concurrency.</div>

    <div class="question">Q2. What is a lambda expression in Java 8, and what are its benefits?</div>
    <div class="answer">Lambda expressions in Java 8 are a way to implement methods from functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method) in a clear and concise manner, using an arrow syntax. The benefits of lambda expressions include reducing the amount of boilerplate code, enhancing readability, and making it easier to use functional programming patterns. They are particularly useful for simplifying code when using collections and APIs that support concurrency, such as the Stream API.</div>

    <div class="question">Q3. What is the difference between a Lambda Expression and an Anonymous Inner Class?</div>
    <div class="answer">Lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes in Java both enable you to implement methods without declaring a formal class, but they differ significantly in simplicity and functionality. Lambda expressions are more concise and focus on passing a single piece of functionality, typically to a single method in a functional interface. In contrast, anonymous inner classes are more verbose and can implement multiple methods from an interface or subclass. Lambda expressions also do not have their own scope, unlike anonymous inner classes, which can shadow variables from the enclosing class.</div>

    <div class="question">Q4. What is a Functional Interface in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, a Functional Interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. These interfaces are intended for use with lambda expressions, which provide the implementation of the abstract method. Functional Interfaces can include other default or static methods without affecting their status. The @FunctionalInterface annotation, although not required, can be used to indicate that an interface is intended to be a Functional Interface, helping to avoid accidental addition of abstract methods in the future.</div>

    <div class="question">Q5. What are some of the predefined functional interfaces in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java 8 introduced several predefined functional interfaces to facilitate lambda expressions and method references. Key examples include Consumer, which accepts a single input and returns no result; Supplier, which provides a result without accepting any input; Function, which takes one argument and returns a result; Predicate, which takes one argument and returns a boolean; and BiFunction, which takes two arguments and returns a result. These interfaces streamline the creation of lambda expressions for common functional programming patterns.</div>

    <div class="question">Q6. What is the Streams API in Java 8? How does it work?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Streams API in Java 8 is a powerful tool for processing sequences of elements in a declarative way. It works by providing a high-level abstraction for performing operations like filtering, mapping, sorting, and more, on collections of objects without modifying the underlying data source. Streams can be sequential or parallel, allowing for efficient data processing. The API emphasizes readability and simplicity, using functional-style operations that leverage lambda expressions for concise and expressive coding.</div>

    <div class="question">Q7. Explain the difference between map() and flatMap() in Streams.</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java Streams, map() and flatMap() are both transformation functions but serve different purposes. map() takes a function and applies it to each element in the stream, returning a stream of the results—essentially transforming each element into a new form. Conversely, flatMap() also applies a function to elements, but each function result is expected to be a stream itself; flatMap() then "flattens" these multiple streams into a single stream. This is particularly useful for handling nested collections or arrays.</div>

    <div class="question">Q8. How can you filter a collection using Streams in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, you can filter a collection using the Streams API by converting the collection to a stream, applying a filter() method, and then specifying a condition within the filter method. The filter() method takes a predicate, which is a functional interface representing a condition that each element of the stream must meet. Elements that satisfy the predicate are retained in the stream, while others are discarded. You can then collect these filtered elements into a new collection if needed.</div>

<div class="question">Q9. What are Default Methods in Java 8, and why were they introduced?</div>
    <div class="answer">Default methods in Java 8 are methods added to interfaces that include an implementation. They were introduced to enable new functionality in interfaces without breaking existing implementations of these interfaces. This feature allows Java to add enhancements to the standard libraries (like the Collections API) while ensuring backward compatibility with older versions. Default methods help evolve interfaces over time without disrupting the classes that implement these interfaces.</div>

    <div class="question">Q10. How are Static Methods in interfaces different from Default Methods in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, static methods in interfaces allow the interface to define methods that can be called on the interface itself, not on instances of classes that implement the interface. This is similar to static methods in classes. Conversely, default methods are methods within an interface that have an implementation. They can be called on instances of classes that implement the interface, providing default behavior without requiring the implementing class to override the method. Static methods help in utility or helper functionality, while default methods aid in enhancing interfaces without breaking existing implementations.</div>

    <div class="question">Q11. What is Optional in Java 8, and how is it used?</div>
    <div class="answer">Optional in Java 8 is a container object used to represent the presence or absence of a value, effectively reducing the problems caused by null references (often termed the billion-dollar mistake). It provides a way to express optional values without using null. This approach helps prevent NullPointerExceptions when accessing values that might not exist. Optional is commonly used in situations where a method might return a meaningful value or no value at all, allowing developers to handle the absence of a value gracefully using methods like isPresent(), ifPresent(), and orElse().</div>

    <div class="question">Q12. How do you handle null values in Java 8 using Optional?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, Optional is used to handle null values gracefully. You can create an Optional object that may or may not contain a non-null value by using methods like Optional.ofNullable(). This method returns an Optional object that is either empty (if the value is null) or contains the value. You can then use methods like orElse() to provide a default value if the Optional is empty, or ifPresent() to execute a block of code only if a value is present. This approach helps avoid NullPointerException and makes your code cleaner and safer.</div>

    <div class="question">Q13. What is the difference between findFirst() and findAny() in Streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java Streams, findFirst() and findAny() are terminal operations that return an Optional describing an element of the stream. findFirst() returns the first element in the stream according to the encounter order, which is particularly useful in sequential streams. On the other hand, findAny() can return any element from the stream and is more performance-efficient in parallel streams, as it allows more flexibility in which element is returned, potentially reducing the time spent on synchronous operations.</div>

    <div class="question">Q14. Explain the purpose of the Collectors class in Java 8.</div>
    <div class="answer">The Collectors class in Java 8 serves as a utility to help with common mutable reductions and collection operations on streams, like grouping elements, summarizing elements, or converting them into collections like Lists, Sets, or Maps. It provides a set of pre-defined static methods that can be used with the collect() method of the Stream API. This makes it easy to perform complex tasks like joining strings, averaging numbers, or categorizing items in a streamlined and efficient manner.</div>
 <div class="question">Q15. What is the significance of the forEach() method in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">The forEach() method in Java 8 is significant for its ability to simplify iterations over collections, including those that are part of the Java Collections Framework or arrays. Implemented as a default method in the Iterable interface and as a terminal operation in the Stream API, forEach() allows you to execute a specific action on each element of a collection or stream. This method enhances readability and reduces boilerplate code associated with traditional for-loops, making operations more concise and expressive, especially when combined with lambda expressions.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q16. How does Java 8 handle parallel processing with the Streams API?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java 8 enhances parallel processing capabilities through the Streams API, which allows for easy parallelization of operations on collections. By invoking the parallelStream() method on a collection, you can create a parallel stream that divides the data into multiple parts, which are processed concurrently across different threads. This leverages multicore processors effectively to improve performance for large data sets. The framework handles the decomposition and merging of data, simplifying parallel execution without the need for explicit thread management.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q17. What is the purpose of the Predicate functional interface in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Predicate functional interface in Java 8 is designed to represent a boolean-valued function of one argument. Its primary purpose is to evaluate a given predicate (a condition that returns true or false) on objects of a specific type. Predicates are often used for filtering or matching objects. For example, in the Streams API, the filter() method uses a Predicate to determine which elements should be included in the resulting stream based on whether they satisfy the predicate. This functionality is crucial for conditional operations in collection processing.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q18. How do you create an infinite stream in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, you can create an infinite stream using the Stream.iterate or Stream.generate methods. Stream.iterate repeatedly applies a given function to a seed value to produce an infinite sequence, for example, generating an infinite stream of natural numbers by successively adding one. Stream.generate takes a Supplier to provide new values and produces an infinite stream of those values. Both methods yield infinite streams that require limiting actions to prevent endless processing.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q19. What is the Function interface in Java 8, and how is it used?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Function interface in Java 8 is a functional interface that represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result. It is commonly used for transforming objects of one type into another, such as converting strings to integers or applying mathematical operations to numbers. The interface is generic, allowing for flexibility in specifying the types of the input and output. In the Streams API, the Function interface is often passed to the map() method to transform stream elements.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q20. What are method references in Java 8, and how do they relate to Lambda Expressions?</div>
    <div class="answer">Method references in Java 8 are a shorthand notation of lambda expressions that refer directly to methods by their names. They serve as a clean and concise way to express instances where lambda expressions simply call existing methods. For example, instead of using a lambda like (x) -> System.out.println(x), you can use the method reference System.out::println. This syntax directly points to the println method, improving code clarity and reducing verbosity when interfacing with functional interfaces.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q21. How can you sort a collection using Streams in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, you can sort a collection using the Streams API by converting the collection into a stream, applying the sorted() method, and then collecting the results back into a collection. The sorted() method can be used without arguments to sort in natural order, or with a comparator if a specific sorting order is needed. Finally, you use the collect(Collectors.toList()) (or another appropriate collector) to gather the sorted elements back into a collection like a list or set. This method provides a fluent, functional approach to sorting data.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q22. What is the use of reduce() in Java 8 Streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">The reduce() method in Java 8 Streams is used to combine all elements of the stream into a single result. This method takes a binary operator as a parameter, which is used to accumulate the elements of the stream. Reduce() is useful for performing operations like summing all numbers in a list, finding the maximum or minimum value, or accumulating elements into a single result. This method essentially reduces a stream of elements to one summary result based on the provided operation.</div>
  <div class="question">Q23. How does the filter() method work in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">The filter() method in Java 8's Streams API is used to evaluate each element in a stream against a given predicate, which is a functional interface that defines a condition returning a boolean value. Elements that pass this condition (i.e., for which the predicate returns true) are included in the resulting stream, while those that do not pass are discarded. This method is particularly useful for extracting subsets of data from collections based on specific criteria.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q24. What is the significance of Collectors.toList() in Java 8 Streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, Collectors.toList() is a collector used in the Stream API to gather stream elements into a new list. This method is typically used with the collect() terminal operation to accumulate the elements of a stream into a list after performing operations like filtering, mapping, or sorting. It simplifies the process of converting a stream back into a collection, making it highly useful for collecting processed data conveniently and efficiently into a commonly used data structure.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q25. Can you explain how Stream.of() works in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, Stream.of() is a static method used to create a stream from a set of individual objects. You can pass one or more objects to this method, and it will return a stream containing the elements you provided. This is particularly useful for quickly turning a few elements into a stream without needing to create a collection first. It's a convenient way to work with a fixed number of elements for stream operations like filtering, mapping, or collecting.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q26. How is Java 8 backward-compatible with earlier versions of Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java 8 maintains backward compatibility with earlier versions by ensuring that existing interfaces can be expanded with new features—like lambda expressions, method references, and stream APIs— without breaking the implementations that depend on older versions. For example, the introduction of default methods in interfaces allows new methods to be added without requiring changes in the implementing classes. This design approach ensures that older Java applications can still run without modification in the newer Java 8 environment.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q27. What is the difference between limit() and skip() in Java 8 Streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8 Streams, limit() and skip() are two intermediate operations that manage the size of the stream. limit(n) is used to truncate the stream so that it contains no more than n elements, effectively limiting the number of items processed downstream. On the other hand, skip(n) discards the first n elements of the stream, allowing the stream to start processing from the element that follows. Together, these methods help in controlling stream flow for specific processing needs.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q28. Explain how to convert a list to a map using Streams in Java 8.</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, you can convert a list to a map using the Streams API by utilizing the collect(Collectors.toMap()) method. First, convert the list into a stream. Then, use toMap() where you specify functions for determining the keys and values for the map. For example, if you have a list of objects, you might use an attribute of the objects as the key and the objects themselves as values. This method effectively organizes elements of a list into a map based on defined criteria.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q29. What is the difference between Stream.iterate() and Stream.generate()?</div>
    <div class="answer">Stream.iterate() and Stream.generate() in Java 8 are both methods for creating infinite streams, but they do so in different ways. Stream.iterate() takes a seed (initial value) and a function, applying the function repeatedly to generate a sequence (e.g., creating a stream of powers of two). Stream.generate(), on the other hand, uses a supplier to provide new values, which doesn't depend on the previous element. This makes Stream.generate() suitable for generating streams where each element is independent of the others.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q30. How can you apply a custom comparator in a stream pipeline in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8, you can apply a custom comparator in a stream pipeline using the sorted() method. First, define your comparator, which dictates how the elements should be compared based on your custom criteria. Then, pass this comparator to the sorted() method within your stream pipeline. For example, if you're streaming a list of objects, you can sort them by a specific attribute using a comparator that compares that attribute. This method integrates seamlessly into the stream, allowing for flexible sorting within the pipeline.</div>
<div class="question">Q31. Can you explain why Java 8 introduced the concept of Default Methods in interfaces, and what problem does it solve?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java 8 introduced default methods in interfaces to enable interfaces to evolve while maintaining backward compatibility with older versions. Previously, adding a new method to an interface required all implementing classes to define that method, potentially breaking existing applications. Default methods allow new functionalities to be added to interfaces without obligating implementing classes to change. This helps in enhancing interfaces with new methods while ensuring that existing implementations do not fail.</div>

    <div class="question">Q32. Is it possible to use this and super in a Lambda expression? Explain why or why not.</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, within lambda expressions, this and super keywords do not refer to the lambda expression itself but rather to the enclosing instance where the lambda is defined. This means this refers to the instance of the class where the lambda is created, and super refers to the superclass of this instance. Therefore, while you can use this and super in lambda expressions, they do not behave as they might be expected to within traditional methods or anonymous inner classes, where they refer directly to the current or parent class object respectively.</div>

    <div class="question">Q33. How can a Lambda expression access variables outside its scope? What is the concept behind it?</div>
    <div class="answer">Lambda expressions in Java can access variables outside their scope, specifically final or effectively final variables from their enclosing scope. An effectively final variable is one that is not modified after initialization. This restriction ensures that the lambda expression is state-consistent and can be safely called multiple times without side effects that could arise from modifying external variables. This capability allows lambda expressions to capture and use local variables in a functional-style programming approach, enhancing their utility and flexibility.</div>

    <div class="question">Q34. Can a Lambda expression throw an exception? How can you handle exceptions in a Lambda?</div>
    <div class="answer">Yes, lambda expressions in Java can throw exceptions, just like regular methods. However, if the functional interface the lambda is implementing does not declare an exception, any checked exceptions thrown within the lambda must either be caught or converted to unchecked exceptions. To handle exceptions directly within a lambda, you can use a try-catch block surrounding the code that might throw the exception. This approach allows the lambda to manage exceptions internally without affecting the external execution flow.</div>

    <div class="question">Q35. What is the difference between Optional.of() and Optional.ofNullable()?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, Optional.of() and Optional.ofNullable() are methods used to create Optional objects, but they handle null values differently. Optional.of(value) requires a non-null value and throws a NullPointerException if passed a null. This is suitable when you are certain the value is not null. In contrast, Optional.ofNullable(value) is safe for use with values that might be null. It returns an empty Optional if the value is null, thus avoiding any exceptions.</div>

    <div class="question">Q36. How does the internal working of Stream.sorted() differ when using natural ordering versus custom comparator?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Stream.sorted() method in Java sorts the elements of a stream either using natural ordering or a custom comparator. When using natural ordering, it assumes that the stream elements implement the Comparable interface and sorts them according to their compareTo method. With a custom comparator, you provide a Comparator object that defines a different sorting logic. This allows for flexibility in sorting based on attributes or rules that do not adhere to the natural order of the elements. Both methods internally use efficient sorting algorithms optimized for performance and stability.</div>

    <div class="question">Q37. Can you use Optional as a method parameter? Why should or shouldn’t you do this?</div>
    <div class="answer">Using Optional as a method parameter in Java is technically possible but generally discouraged. The primary purpose of Optional is to provide a more expressive alternative to null references and to enhance readability and safety in APIs by clearly indicating that a method might not return a value. Using Optional as a parameter complicates method signatures and usage, potentially obscuring intent and leading to less clean code. Instead, it's better to use Optional for return types where it clarifies that a method might not produce a value.</div>
	
 <div class="question">Q38. What will happen if you try to modify a local variable inside a Lambda expression?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, if you try to modify a local variable inside a lambda expression, you'll encounter a compile-time error. Local variables accessed from within a lambda must be final or effectively final—meaning once they are initialized, they cannot be modified. This restriction ensures that the lambda does not introduce side effects by altering the local environment, preserving thread safety and functional programming principles where functions do not modify the state outside their scope.</div>

    <div class="question">Q39. Can you use the synchronized keyword inside a Lambda expression?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, you cannot directly use the synchronized keyword inside the body of a lambda expression in Java. Lambda expressions are meant to be short, stateless, and concise blocks of code. They do not have an intrinsic lock object to synchronize on, unlike methods in a class. If synchronization is necessary within a lambda, you must handle it externally, such as synchronizing on an external object or using higher-level concurrency utilities provided by Java.</div>

    <div class="question">Q40. What is the difference between count(), sum(), and reduce() in Java 8 Streams?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java 8 Streams, count(), sum(), and reduce() serve different purposes: count() simply returns the number of elements in the stream, useful for tallying items. sum(), available in specialized stream types like IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream, calculates the total of the elements. reduce(), on the other hand, is a more general method that combines all elements in the stream using a provided binary operator to produce a single result, allowing for more complex accumulations beyond just summing.</div>
	
<h2>Concurrency and multi-threading</h2>

	 <div class="question">Q1. What is a thread in Java and how can we create it?</div>
    <div class="answer">A thread in Java is a pathway of execution within a program. You can create a thread by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.</div>

    <div class="question">Q2. Can you explain the lifecycle of a Java thread?</div>
    <div class="answer">A Java thread lifecycle includes states: New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated.</div>

    <div class="question">Q3. How would you handle a scenario where two threads need to update the same data structure?</div>
    <div class="answer">Use synchronized blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can access the data structure at a time, preventing concurrent modification issues.</div>

    <div class="question">Q4. Can we start a thread twice?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, a thread in Java cannot be started more than once. Attempting to restart a thread that has already run will throw an IllegalThreadStateException.</div>

    <div class="question">Q5. What is the difference between Thread class and Runnable interface in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Thread class defines a thread of execution, whereas the Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.</div>

    <div class="question">Q6. How can you ensure a method is thread-safe in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">To ensure thread safety, use synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks, volatile variables, or concurrent data structures.</div>

    <div class="question">Q7. What are volatile variables?</div>
    <div class="answer">Volatile variables in Java are used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads, ensuring that the value read is always the latest written.</div>

    <div class="question">Q8. What is thread synchronization and why is it important?</div>
    <div class="answer">Thread synchronization controls the access of multiple threads to shared resources to prevent data inconsistency and ensure thread safety.</div>

    <div class="question">Q9. Can you describe a scenario where you would use wait() and notify() methods in thread communication?</div>
    <div class="answer">Use wait() and notify() for inter-thread communication, like when one thread needs to wait for another to complete a task before proceeding.</div>

    <div class="question">Q10. What challenges might you face with multithreaded programs in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, multithreaded programming can lead to issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and resource contention, which complicate debugging and affect performance. Managing thread safety and synchronization efficiently is also a significant challenge.</div>

    <div class="question">Q11. What is the Java Memory Model (JMM) and how is it linked to threads?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines the rules by which Java programs achieve consistency when reading and writing variables across multiple threads, ensuring all threads have a consistent view of memory. It governs how changes to variables are propagated and how synchronization constructs like volatile and synchronized affect visibility and ordering of operations.</div>

<h2>Concurrency and Multithreading Advance</h2>

<div class="question">Q1. How would you ensure that a shared resource is accessed safely by multiple threads?</div>
    <div class="answer">To ensure safe access to a shared resource by multiple threads in Java, you can use synchronization. This involves using the synchronized keyword to lock an object or a method while a thread is using it. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time, preventing other threads from accessing the locked code until the lock is released. This mechanism helps avoid conflicts and data corruption by ensuring that only one thread can modify the shared resource at any given time.</div>

    <div class="question">Q2. Explain the synchronized keyword in Java. How does it work?</div>
    <div class="answer">The synchronized keyword in Java is used to control access to a critical section of code by locking an object or method so that only one thread can execute it at a time. When a thread enters a synchronized block or method, it obtains a lock on the specified object or class, preventing other threads from entering any synchronized blocks or methods that lock the same object or class until the lock is released. This ensures that the shared data is accessed in a thread-safe manner.</div>

    <div class="question">Q3. What are the differences between using synchronized on a method versus on a block of code?</div>
    <div class="answer">Using synchronized on a method locks the entire method, so when a thread enters this method, no other thread can enter any synchronized method of that object until the lock is released. However, using synchronized on a block of code only locks that specific block. This allows finer control over which parts of the code need synchronization, potentially improving performance by reducing the scope of locking to just critical sections of the code.</div>

    <div class="question">Q4. What is the significance of the volatile keyword in Java concurrency?</div>
    <div class="answer">The volatile keyword in Java concurrency is crucial for ensuring visibility and preventing caching of variables across threads. When a variable is declared as volatile, it tells the JVM that every read or write to that variable should go directly to main memory, bypassing any intermediate caches. This ensures that changes made to a volatile variable by one thread are immediately visible to other threads, maintaining data consistency across threads without using synchronized blocks.</div>

    <div class="question">Q5. How does the introduction of Lambda expressions change the way Java handles concurrency?</div>
    <div class="answer">Lambda expressions in Java simplify the way concurrency is handled primarily by reducing the verbosity and complexity of anonymous classes, making code more readable and concise. They facilitate the use of functional programming techniques within Java, particularly in dealing with concurrency frameworks like Streams and CompletableFuture, which rely heavily on passing behaviors (functions) as arguments. Lambdas enable cleaner and more maintainable concurrent processing by allowing developers to focus on the logic rather than boilerplate code.</div>

    <div class="question">Q6. Explain the Java concurrency model.</div>
    <div class="answer">The Java concurrency model is built around threads, which are units of execution within a process. Java provides a rich set of tools and APIs, like Thread class, Runnable interface, and concurrency utilities in the java.util.concurrent package, to manage and synchronize these threads. This model allows multiple threads to run in parallel, enhancing performance especially in multi-core processors. Synchronization and coordination between threads are achieved through mechanisms like locks, synchronized blocks/methods, and concurrent data structures, ensuring safe communication between threads.</div>

    <div class="question">Q7. What are the challenges associated with Java’s thread management?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java's thread management presents several challenges, including the complexity of ensuring thread safety, which requires careful synchronization to avoid issues like data corruption and deadlocks. Managing thread life cycles and resource allocation efficiently can also be difficult, as threads consume system resources. Overuse of threading can lead to high CPU usage and slower application performance. Additionally, debugging multithreaded applications is often more complex due to the unpredictable nature of thread execution.</div>

    <div class="question">Q8. Can volatile variables be used as a replacement for synchronization?</div>
    <div class="answer">Volatile variables cannot fully replace synchronization in Java. While they ensure that the value of a variable is consistently updated across all threads (ensuring visibility), they do not provide the mutual exclusion necessary for complex synchronization. For operations that go beyond the simple reading and writing of a single variable, such as incrementing a counter or checking and modifying multiple variables, synchronized blocks or locks are necessary to prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.</div>
	<div class="question">Q9. Can a deadlock occur with a single thread?</div>
    <div class="answer">A deadlock typically involves two or more threads, where each thread is waiting for another to release a resource they need. However, a single thread can experience a similar issue called a self-deadlock or resource starvation if it recursively acquires a non-reentrant lock it already holds without releasing it first.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q10. What is a synchronized collection, and how does it differ from a concurrent collection?</div>
    <div class="answer">A synchronized collection in Java is a standard collection that has been wrapped with synchronization to make it thread-safe. A concurrent collection, like those in java.util.concurrent, is designed for simultaneous access with better performance using finer-grained locking or lock-free mechanisms.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q11. How does Java handle multi-threading?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java handles multi-threading by allowing multiple threads to run concurrently within a single application using the Thread class and Runnable interface. Java provides built-in support for thread lifecycle management, synchronization, and inter-thread communication.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q12. What are the differences between Runnable and Callable in Java concurrency?</div>
    <div class="answer">Runnable has a run() method that does not return a result, while Callable includes a call() method that returns a result and can throw checked exceptions, making it more suitable for tasks requiring outcomes.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q13. How do you handle thread interruption in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Thread interruption in Java is handled by checking the interrupted status using Thread.interrupted() or isInterrupted(). A thread should properly clean up resources before stopping execution upon detecting an interruption.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q14. How do you check if a Thread holds a lock or not?</div>
    <div class="answer">You can check if a thread holds a lock using Thread.holdsLock(Object obj), which returns true if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified object.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q15. What are use cases of ThreadLocal variables in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">ThreadLocal variables provide thread-specific data storage without synchronization. They are useful for maintaining per-thread user sessions, transaction IDs, or temporary credentials.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q16. What is the role of ExecutorService in the Executor Framework? What methods does it provide?</div>
    <div class="answer">ExecutorService manages and controls thread execution efficiently. It provides methods such as submit() for executing callable tasks, execute() for running runnable tasks, and shutdown() to stop the executor service gracefully.</div>
	 <div class="question">Q17. What is the difference between submit() and execute() methods in the Executor Framework?</div>
    <div class="answer">In the Java Executor Framework, the submit() and execute() methods both schedule tasks for execution, but they differ in key aspects. The execute() method is used to run Runnable tasks and does not return any result. Conversely, the submit() method can accept both Runnable and Callable tasks, returning a Future object that can be used to retrieve the Callable task’s result or check the status of the Runnable. This makes submit() more flexible and useful for handling tasks that produce results.</div>

    <div class="question">Q18. What is the RejectedExecutionHandler in ThreadPoolExecutor? How can you customize it?</div>
    <div class="answer">The RejectedExecutionHandler in a ThreadPoolExecutor in Java is an interface that handles tasks that cannot be executed by the thread pool, typically when the pool is fully utilized and the task queue is full. You can customize it by implementing this interface and defining your own rejectedExecution method. This method decides what to do with the rejected tasks, such as logging them, running them on a different executor, or implementing a backoff and retry mechanism. This customization allows for more robust handling of task overflows in applications.</div>

    <div class="question">Q19. How does ConcurrentHashMap work internally?</div>
    <div class="answer">The ConcurrentHashMap in Java is designed for concurrent access without the extensive use of synchronization. Internally, it divides the data into segments, effectively a hashtable-like structure. Each segment manages its own lock, reducing contention by allowing multiple threads to concurrently access different segments of the map. This means that read operations can generally be performed without locking, and writes require minimal locking, significantly increasing performance over a Hashtable or synchronized Map under concurrent access scenarios.</div>

    <div class="question">Q20. Difference Between synchronized and ReentrantLock?</div>
    <div class="answer">The synchronized keyword and ReentrantLock both provide locking mechanisms in Java, but they differ in functionality and flexibility. synchronized is easier to use and automatically handles locking and unlocking, but offers less control. In contrast, ReentrantLock provides more advanced features, such as the ability to try to acquire a lock without waiting forever, lock interruptibility, and support for fairness policies. Additionally, ReentrantLock allows multiple condition variables per lock, facilitating more complex synchronization scenarios.</div>

    <div class="question">Q21. What happens when an exception occurs inside a synchronized block?</div>
    <div class="answer">When an exception occurs inside a synchronized block in Java, the lock that was acquired when entering the synchronized block is automatically released. This allows other threads to enter the synchronized block or method once the current thread has exited due to the exception. Essentially, the synchronized mechanism ensures that locks are managed cleanly, even in the event of an exception, preventing deadlocks and allowing program execution to continue in other threads.</div>

    <div class="question">Q22. How do you get a thread dump in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">To obtain a thread dump in Java, you can use several methods depending on the environment. One common way is to send a SIGQUIT signal by pressing Ctrl+\ in Unix/Linux or Ctrl+Break in Windows on the command line where the Java application is running. Alternatively, you can use tools like jstack with the process ID to generate a thread dump. This tool is part of the JDK and provides detailed information about the threads running in your Java application.</div>

    <div class="question">Q23. How to get a thread dump in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">To obtain a thread dump in Java, you can use several methods depending on the environment. One common way is to send a SIGQUIT signal by pressing Ctrl+\ in Unix/Linux or Ctrl+Break in Windows on the command line where the Java application is running.

This tool is part of the JDK and provides detailed information about the threads running in your Java application.</div>

    <div class="question">Q24. What are the different ways to achieve synchronization in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, synchronization can be achieved through several methods to ensure thread safety. The primary way is using the synchronized keyword, which can be applied to methods or blocks of code to restrict access to a resource to one thread at a time. Additionally, Java provides volatile variables to ensure visibility of changes to variables across threads. More sophisticated synchronization can involve using classes from the java.util.concurrent package, like ReentrantLock, Semaphore, and CountDownLatch, which offer more control and flexibility than synchronized.</div>

    <div class="question">Q25. What is the difference between synchronized method and synchronized block?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, a synchronized method locks the entire method at the object or class level, depending on whether the method is an instance method or static, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time. In contrast, a synchronized block provides more granular control by only locking a specific section of a method or a specific object, which can minimize waiting times for threads and improve performance by reducing the scope of the lock.</div>

<div class="question">Q1. What is collection framework in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Java Collection Framework is a set of tools that helps us organize, store, and manage groups of data easily. It includes various types of collections like lists, sets, and maps.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q2. What are the main interfaces of the Java Collection Framework?</div>
    <div class="answer">The main parts of the Java Collection Framework are interfaces like Collection, List, Set, Queue, and Map. Each one helps manage data in different ways.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q3. Can you explain how Iterator works within the Java Collection Framework?</div>
    <div class="answer">An Iterator is a tool in the Collection Framework that lets you go through a collection's elements one by one.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q4. What are some common methods available in all Collection types?</div>
    <div class="answer">Some common methods all collection types have are add, remove, clear, size, and isEmpty. These methods let us add and remove items, check the size, and see if the collection is empty.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q5. How does Java Collection Framework handle concurrency?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Collection Framework deals with multiple threads using special collection classes like ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList, which let different parts of our program modify the collection at the same time safely.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q6. How do you choose the right collection type for a specific problem?</div>
    <div class="answer">To pick the right collection type, think about what we need: List if you want an ordered collection that can include duplicates, Set if you need unique elements, Queue for processing elements in order, and Map for storing pairs of keys and values.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q7. What enhancements were made to the Java Collection Framework in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">Java 8 made improvements to the Collection Framework by adding Streams, which make it easier to handle collections in bulk, and lambda expressions, which simplify writing code for operations on collections.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q8. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?</div>
    <div class="answer">Iterator allows forward traversal of a collection, while ListIterator extends Iterator functionality to allow bidirectional traversal of lists and also supports element modification.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q9. Name of algorithm used by Arrays.sort(..) and Collections.sort(..)?</div>
    <div class="answer">Arrays.sort() uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm for primitive types and TimSort for object arrays. Collections.sort() uses TimSort, a hybrid sorting algorithm combining merge sort and insertion sort.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q10. How do you store elements in a set to preserve insertion order?</div>
    <div class="answer">Use a LinkedHashSet, which preserves the insertion order of elements.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q11. How do you store elements in a way that they are sorted?</div>
    <div class="answer">Use a TreeSet or a TreeMap, which automatically sorts elements based on their natural ordering or a specified comparator.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q12. What's the use case of ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet?</div>
    <div class="answer"><strong>ArrayList:</strong> Use it when you need efficient random access to elements via indices, like retrieving elements frequently from a list without altering it.</div>
    <div class="answer"><strong>LinkedList:</strong> Use it when you frequently add and remove elements from the beginning or middle of the list, such as implementing queues or stacks.</div>
    <div class="answer"><strong>HashSet:</strong> Use it when you need to ensure that there are no duplicates and require fast lookups, additions, and deletions. It is ideal for scenarios like checking membership existence, such as in a set of unique items or keys.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q13. How does a HashSet ensure that there are no duplicates?</div>
    <div class="answer">A HashSet in Java uses a HashMap under the hood. Each element you add is treated as a key in this HashMap. Since keys in a HashMap are unique, HashSet automatically prevents any duplicate entries.</div>
	<div class="question">Q13. Can you describe how hashCode() and equals() work together in a collection?</div>
    <div class="answer">hashCode() determines which bucket an object goes into, while equals() checks equality between objects in the same bucket to handle collisions, ensuring that each key is unique.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q14. Why is it important to override the hashCode method when you override equals? What would be the consequence if we don’t?</div>
    <div class="answer">Overriding hashCode() is crucial because hash-based collections like HashMap and HashSet use the hashcode to locate objects. Without consistent hashCode() and equals(), objects may not be found or stored correctly.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q15. Can you give an example where a TreeSet is more appropriate than HashSet?</div>
    <div class="answer">A TreeSet is more appropriate than a HashSet when you need to maintain the elements in a sorted order. For example, if we are managing a list of customer names that must be displayed alphabetically, using a TreeSet would be ideal.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q16. What is the internal implementation of ArrayList and LinkedList?</div>
    <div class="answer">ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array, which provides O(1) access time but requires resizing. LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-linked list, providing O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends but O(n) access time.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q17. Can you explain the internal working of HashMap in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs in an array where each element is a bucket. It uses a hash function to determine which bucket a key should go into for efficient data retrieval. If two keys end up in the same bucket, a collision happens. The HashMap manages these collisions by maintaining a linked list or a balanced tree depending on the Java version in each bucket.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q18. What happens when two keys have the same hash code? How would you handle this scenario?</div>
    <div class="answer">When two different Java objects have the same hashcode, it's called a hash collision. In this case, Java handles it by storing both objects in the same bucket in a hash-based collection, like a HashMap. It then compares the objects using the equals() method to differentiate them.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q19. How does a HashMap handle collisions in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">In Java, when a HashMap encounters a collision (two keys with the same hashcode), it stores both entries in the same bucket. Prior to Java 8, it linked them in a simple list structure. In Java 8, if the number of entries in a bucket grows large, the list is converted to a balanced tree for faster lookups.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q20. Can you please tell me what changes were done for the HashMap in Java 8?</div>
    <div class="answer">Before Java 8, HashMap dealt with collisions by using a simple linked list. Starting from Java 8, when too many items end up in the same bucket, the list turns into a balanced tree, which helps speed up searching.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q21. Can we include a class as a key in HashMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">No, as a functional interface allows only a single abstract method. However, a functional interface can inherit another interface if it contains only static and default methods in it.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q22. Can you please explain ConcurrentHashMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">ConcurrentHashMap is a version of HashMap that's safe to use by many threads at once without needing to lock the entire map. It divides the map into parts that can be locked separately, allowing better performance.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q23. How does ConcurrentHashMap improve performance in a multi-threaded environment?</div>
    <div class="answer">ConcurrentHashMap boosts performance in multi-threaded settings by letting different threads access and modify different parts of the map simultaneously, reducing waiting times and improving efficiency.</div>
	 <div class="question">Q1. What is collection framework in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">The Java Collection Framework is a set of tools that helps us organize, store, and manage groups of data easily. It includes various types of collections like lists, sets, and maps.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q24. What is the time complexity of insertions, deletions, and retrievals in HashSet and HashMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Insertion:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Average: O(1)</li>
                <li>Worst case: O(n) when rehashing occurs</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Average: O(1)</li>
                <li>Worst case: O(n) when rehashing occurs</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Average: O(1)</li>
                <li>Worst case: O(n) when rehashing occurs (due to hash collisions)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: HashSet and HashMap are not internally sorted.</p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">Q25. What is the time complexity of insertions, deletions, and retrievals in TreeSet and TreeMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">O(log n) for operations like insertions, deletions, and retrievals.<br>Note: TreeSet and TreeMap maintain elements in sorted order.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Q26. What techniques do HashMap, TreeMap, HashSet, and TreeSet use internally for performing operations?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HashMap</strong> uses an array of nodes, where each node is a linked list or a tree depending on collisions and Java versions. From Java 8 onwards, if there are high hash collisions, the linked list gets converted to a balanced tree.</li>
            <li><strong>TreeMap</strong> uses a Red-Black tree, which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node in the Red-Black tree stores a key-value pair.</li>
            <li><strong>HashSet</strong> internally uses a HashMap.</li>
            <li><strong>TreeSet</strong> internally uses a TreeMap.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
	<h2>Design Patterns and Principles Basics</h2>

<div class="question">Q1. What is a design pattern in Java and why do we use it?</div>
    <div class="answer">Design patterns are best practices and solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to coding, improving maintainability, scalability, and reusability.</div>

    <div class="question">Q2. Can you list and explain a few common design patterns used in Java programming?</div>
    <div class="answer">Common design patterns in Java:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Singleton:</strong> Ensures a class has only one instance, with a global access point.</li>
            <li><strong>Observer:</strong> Allows objects to notify others about changes in their state.</li>
            <li><strong>Factory Method:</strong> Delegates the creation of objects to subclasses, promoting flexibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Builder:</strong> Separates object construction from its representation, making it easier to create complex objects.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question">Q3. How can design patterns affect the performance of a Java application?</div>
    <div class="answer">Design patterns can introduce slight performance overhead due to abstraction layers, but they enhance modularity, maintainability, and scalability, which are critical for long-term software development.</div>

    <div class="question">Q4. Which design pattern would you use to manage database connections efficiently in a Java application?</div>
    <div class="answer">The <strong>Singleton</strong> pattern is commonly used for managing database connections, ensuring a single shared connection instance is reused efficiently, preventing unnecessary resource consumption.</div>

    <div class="question">Q5. How do you choose the appropriate design pattern for a particular problem in Java?</div>
    <div class="answer">Understanding the problem domain, evaluating common design patterns, and assessing their impact on maintainability, performance, and extensibility help in choosing the right pattern.</div>

    <div class="question">Q6. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">HashMap stores key-value pairs without ordering, providing O(1) lookup time in ideal cases. TreeMap, on the other hand, maintains keys in sorted order and has a time complexity of O(log n) for operations.</div>

    <div class="question">Q7. In what scenarios would you prefer to use a TreeMap over a HashMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">Use TreeMap when you need to maintain a sorted order of keys, such as implementing a navigation system or a ranking system. HashMap is preferable for fast, unordered key-value lookups.</div>

    <div class="question">Q8. Can we add objects as keys in a TreeMap?</div>
    <div class="answer">Yes, objects can be used as keys in a TreeMap if they implement the <strong>Comparable</strong> interface or a custom <strong>Comparator</strong> is provided to define the sorting logic.</div>
	
	<div class="question">Q9. What are SOLID Principles?</div>
<div class="answer">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>S - Single Responsibility Principle:</strong> A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should handle only one functionality.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> A class <code>VehicleRegistration</code> should only handle vehicle registration details. If it also manages vehicle insurance, it violates this principle.
        </li>
        <li><strong>O - Open/Closed Principle:</strong> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> A <code>VehicleService</code> class providing maintenance services should allow extension through subclasses like <code>ElectricVehicleService</code> without modifying the original class.
        </li>
        <li><strong>L - Liskov Substitution Principle:</strong> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> A superclass <code>Vehicle</code> with a method <code>startEngine()</code> should allow substitution with subclasses like <code>Car</code> and <code>ElectricCar</code> without breaking the system.
        </li>
        <li><strong>I - Interface Segregation Principle:</strong> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use; large interfaces should be split into smaller ones.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> Instead of one large interface <code>VehicleOperations</code> with methods like <code>drive()</code>, <code>refuel()</code>, <code>charge()</code>, and <code>navigate()</code>, split it into focused interfaces like <code>Drivable</code>, <code>Refuelable</code>, and <code>Navigable</code>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>D - Dependency Inversion Principle:</strong> High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.<br>
            <em>Example:</em> A <code>VehicleTracker</code> class that logs vehicle positions should interact through a <code>GPSDevice</code> interface instead of depending directly on a specific GPS device model.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Miscellaneous questions </h2>
<div class="question">Q1. What is transient?</div>
<div class="answer">
    The <code>transient</code> keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. This means it will be ignored when objects are serialized and deserialized.
</div>

<div class="question">Q2. Can we create a server in a Java application without using Spring or any other framework?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Yes, you can create a server in a Java application using only Java SE APIs, such as by utilizing the <code>ServerSocket</code> class for a simple TCP server or the <code>HttpServer</code> class for HTTP services.
</div>

<div class="question">Q3. What is the Exchanger class?</div>
<div class="answer">
    The <code>Exchanger</code> class in Java is a synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within pairs. Each thread presents some object on exchange and receives another object in return from another thread.
</div>

<div class="question">Q4. What is reflection in Java?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Reflection in Java is a capability to inspect and modify the runtime behavior of applications. It allows programs to manipulate internal properties of classes, methods, and interfaces, and dynamically call them at runtime.
</div>

<div class="question">Q5. What is the difference between weak reference and soft reference in Java?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Weak references in Java are garbage collected when no strong references exist. Soft references are only cleared at the discretion of the garbage collector, typically when memory is low.
</div>

<div class="question">Q6. What is Java Flight Recorder?</div>
<div class="answer">
    Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a tool for collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application without significant performance overhead.
</div>

<div class="question">Q7. Discuss Java Generics.</div>
<div class="answer">
    Generics provide type safety by allowing classes and methods to operate on objects of specific types, preventing runtime <code>ClassCastException</code> and reducing code duplication.
</div>

<div class="question">Q8. What is the difference between Young Generation and Old Generation memory spaces?</div>
<div class="answer">
    The Young Generation stores newly created objects. The Old Generation holds objects that have survived several garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation.

<p><b>Can you tell me the difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK?</b></p>
<p>The JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode and making Java platform-independent. The JRE contains the JVM and the standard libraries that Java programs need to run. The JDK is development kit for developers that contains everything in the JRE plus tools like compilers and debuggers to create Java applications.</p>
<p><b>What are the key components of JVM Architecture?</b></p>
<p>JVM has three components, the ClassLoader, the runtime data areas and the execution engine.
The Class Loader loads class files into the JVM. The Runtime Data Areas store data needed while the program runs, like memory for variables and code. The Execution Engine actually runs the instructions in the class files.</p>
<p><b>Can a Java application be run without installing the JRE?</b></p>
<p>We can't run a Java application without having the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) because it has the essential tools and libraries the application needs to work. But, there's a cool tool called jlink in newer Java versions that lets us bundle our Java application with its own little version of the JRE</p>
<p><b>Is it possible to have the JDK installed without having the JRE?</b></p>
<p>No, the JDK contains the JRE. It's not possible to have a JDK without a JRE, as the JRE contains essential components for running Java applications, which the JDK also uses for development.</p>

<p><b>What are Memory storages available with JVM?</b></p>
<p>JVM memory is divided into Heap Space, Stack Memory, Method Area (Metaspace in Java 8 and above), and Native Method Stacks.
Heap space in Java is where the program stores objects and data that it creates and shares.
Stack memory is used for keeping track of what happens inside each function call, including variable values.
The Method Area, or Metaspace in newer Java versions, stores information about the program's classes, like methods and constants.
</p>
<p><b>Which is faster to access between heap and stack, and why?</b></p>
The stack is faster to access because it stores method calls and local variables in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure. The heap, used for dynamic memory allocation (objects), is slower due to its more complex management.

<p><b>How does garbage collection work in Java?</b></p>
<p>Garbage collection in Java automatically frees memory by removing objects that are no longer used. It frees the memory by unused objects, making space for new objects.</p>

<p><b>Whats the role of finalized() method in garbage collection?</b></p>
<p>The finalize() method is called by the garbage collector on an object when it determines that there are no more references to the object. It's meant to give the object a chance to clean up resources before it's collected, such as closing file streams or releasing network connections.
</p>
	<p><b>Can you tell me what algorithm JVM uses for garbage collection?</b></p>
<p>JVM uses multiple garbage collection algorithms such as Mark-Sweep, Mark- Compact, and Generational Copying, depending on the collector chosen
</p>
<p><b>How can memory leaks occur in Java even we have automatic garbage collection?</b></b>
<p>Memory leaks in Java occur when objects are no longer needed but still referenced from other reachable objects, and hence preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming their memory.
</p>

<b><p>Java Fundamentals</b></p>

<div class="question">Q1. Is Java 100% object-oriented programming language?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, Java is not considered 100% object-oriented because it uses primitive types (like int, char, etc.) that are not objects.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q2. What are the advantages of Java being partially object-oriented?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Using simple, non-object types like integers and booleans helps Java run faster and use less memory.</li>
                <li>The mix of features allows Java to work well with other technologies and systems, which might not be fully object-oriented.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q3. What is the use of object-oriented programming languages in enterprise projects?</div>
        <div class="answer">Object-oriented programming (OOP) is used in big projects to make coding easier to handle. It helps organize code better, makes it easier to update and scale, and lets programmers reuse code, saving time and effort.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q4. Explain public static void main(String args[])?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Java, public static void main(String[] args) is the entry point of any standalone Java application.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q5. What will happen if we don’t declare the main method as static?</div>
        <div class="answer">If the main method is not declared as static, the JVM will not be able to launch the application.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q6. Can we override the main method?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, the main method cannot be overridden because it is a static method.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q7. Can JVM execute our overloaded main method?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, JVM only calls the original main method and does not execute overloaded versions.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q8. What’s the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?</div>
        <div class="answer">Primitive data types are predefined and not objects, while non-primitive data types are objects and can call methods.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q9. Can primitive data types be NULL?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, primitive data types cannot be null. They have default values.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q10. Can we declare pointers in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, Java does not support pointers for security reasons.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q11. What are wrapper classes?</div>
        <div class="answer">Wrapper classes allow primitive data types to be treated as objects. Examples include Integer, Double, etc.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q12. Why do we need wrapper classes?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>They provide methods like valueOf() and parseInt().</li>
                <li>They enable autoboxing and unboxing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">Q13. Why do we use wrapper classes in collections?</div>
        <div class="answer">Java collections can only store objects, so wrapper classes allow primitives to be stored in collections.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q14. What is the difference between unboxing and autoboxing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Autoboxing converts a primitive to a wrapper object, while unboxing converts a wrapper object back to a primitive.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q15. Can autoboxing cause unexpected behavior?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, comparing two Integer objects using == might give unexpected results for values outside the range of -128 to 127.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q16. Can autoboxing and unboxing cause a NullPointerException?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, if a null object is unboxed, a NullPointerException will occur.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q17. What is the role of try, catch, and finally in exception handling?</div>
        <div class="answer">The try block contains risky code, catch handles exceptions, and finally executes cleanup code.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q18. What happens if return is used inside try or catch?</div>
        <div class="answer">The finally block still executes before returning the value.</div>
        
        <div class="question">Q19. Can we use try with finally without a catch block?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, a try block can be used with finally without a catch block to ensure cleanup occurs.</div>
		 <div class="question">Q20. How does exception handling with try-catch-finally affect the performance of a Java application?</div>
        <div class="answer">Using try-catch-finally can affect performance slightly due to the overhead of managing exceptions but is generally minimal unless exceptions are thrown frequently.</div>

        <div class="question">Q21. Can you tell me a condition where the finally block will not be executed?</div>
        <div class="answer">The finally block will not execute if the JVM exits via System.exit() during try or catch execution.</div>

        <div class="question">Q22. Can we write multiple finally blocks in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, each try can only have one finally block. Multiple finally blocks are not allowed within a single try-catch-finally structure.</div>

        <div class="question">Q23. What is an exception and the differences between checked and unchecked exceptions?</div>
        <div class="answer">An exception is an unwanted event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the flow. Checked exceptions must be declared or handled (e.g., IOException), whereas unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared or caught (e.g., NullPointerException).</div>

        <div class="question">Q24. How would you handle multiple exceptions in a single catch block?</div>
        <div class="answer">Use a single catch block for multiple exceptions by separating them with a pipe (|), e.g., catch (IOException | SQLException e), to handle both exceptions with the same logic.</div>

        <div class="question">Q25. What is the difference between a Throwable and an Exception in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">Throwable is the superclass for all errors and exceptions. Exception is a subclass of Throwable representing recoverable conditions, while Error (another subclass) represents serious issues the application should not attempt to recover from.</div>

        <div class="question">Q26. Discuss the difference between finalize() and finally. Under what circumstances might finalize() not get called in a Java application?</div>
        <div class="answer">finalize() is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed, while finally is used in a try-catch block to execute code regardless of exceptions. finalize() may not get called if the garbage collector doesn't run or the JVM shuts down.</div>

        <div class="question">Q27. What is the string pool?</div>
        <div class="answer">A Java String Pool is a place in heap memory where all the strings defined in the program are stored. Whenever a new string object is created, the JVM checks for its presence in the String pool. If the String is available in the pool, the same object reference is shared; otherwise, a new object is created.</div>

        <div class="question">Q28. Are there any scenarios where using the string pool might not be beneficial?</div>
        <div class="answer">It will not be beneficial when there are a lot of unique strings because it will be complex to check each string.</div>

        <div class="question">Q29. Can you please tell me about String and StringBuffer?</div>
        <div class="answer">String in Java is immutable, meaning once created, its value cannot be changed. StringBuffer is mutable, allowing for modification of its contents, and is thread-safe, making it suitable for use in multithreaded environments where strings need to be altered.</div>

        <div class="question">Q30. How does StringBuilder differ from StringBuffer, and when should each be used?</div>
        <div class="answer">StringBuilder is similar to StringBuffer but is not thread-safe, making it faster for single-threaded scenarios.</div>

        <div class="question">Q31. Give a scenario where StringBuffer is better than String.</div>
        <div class="answer">A scenario where StringBuffer is more appropriate than String is in a multi-threaded server application where multiple threads modify a shared string, such as constructing a complex log entry concurrently from different threads.</div>

        <div class="question">Q32. What is the difference between a String literal and a String object?</div>
        <div class="answer">A String literal is stored in the String pool for reusability. A String object, created using new String(), is stored in the heap, even if it has the same value as a literal.</div>

        <div class="question">Q33. Why is String immutable?</div>
        <div class="answer">String is immutable to improve security, caching, and performance by ensuring that its value cannot be changed once created.</div>

        <div class="question">Q34. What are the packages in Java?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Java, packages are namespaces that organize classes and interfaces into groups, preventing naming conflicts and managing access control. They provide a structured way to manage Java code, allowing related classes to be grouped together logically.</div>

        <div class="question">Q35. Why are packages used?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            1. They help in organizing code.<br>
            2. Packages prevent naming conflicts by providing a unique namespace.<br>
            3. Packages support modularity by allowing developers to separate the program.<br>
            4. Organizing classes into packages makes it easier to locate related classes.

Object Oriented Programming Concepts


<p><b>What are access modifies in java?</b></p>
ava uses public, protected, default (no modifier), and private to control access to classes, methods, and fields, ensuring appropriate visibility and encapsulation.
<p><b>Can you provide examples of when to use each type of access modifier?</b></p>
1.	Public: Used when members should be accessible from any other class.
2.	Protected: Ideal for members that should be accessible to subclasses and classes within the same package.
3.	Default: Use when members should be accessible only within the same package.
4.	Private: Best for members intended only for use within their own class.

<p><b>Why do we use getters setter when we can make fields publick and setting getting directly?</b></p>
Using getters and setters instead of public variables allows us to control how values are set and accessed, add validation, and keep the ability to change how data is stored without affecting other parts of your program.
<p><b>Can a top-level class be private or protected in Java?</b></p>
No, a top-level class cannot be private or protected because it restricts access, making it unusable from any other classes, contrary to the purpose of a top-level class.


<p><b>Explain the concepts of classes and objects in Java.</b></p>
Classes are blueprints for objects in Java, defining the state and behavior that the objects of the class can have. Objects are instances of classes, representing entities with states and behaviors defined by their class.
<p><b>What are the ways to create an object?</b></p>
1.	Using the new Keyword, example: MyClass object = new MyClass();


 
2.	Using Class Factory Methods, example: Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();
3.	Using the clone()
<p><b>Can a class in Java be without any methods or fields?</b></p>
Yes, a class in Java can be declared without any methods or fields. Such a class can still be used to create objects, although these objects would have no specific behavior or state
<p><b>What are the methods available in the Object class, and how are they used?</b></p>
The key methods are equals(), hashCode(), toString(), clone(), finalize(), wait(), notify(), and notifyAll(). These provide basic operations like equality checks, memory management, and thread coordination.

<p><b>What are anonymous classes and their advantages?</b></p>
Anonymous classes in Java are classes without a name, defined and instantiated in one place. They are useful when you need to create a subclass or implement an interface for a one-time use. The advantages include reduced boilerplate code, encapsulation of specific functionality, and the ability to override methods on the fly. This results in more compact and localized code, particularly in scenarios like event handling or passing behavior as an argument.

<p><b>What is Singleton Class?</b></p>
A singleton class in Java is a special class that can have only one instance (or object) at any time. It's like having only one key of the room. This is useful when we want to make sure there's just one shared resource, like a configuration setting or a connection to a database.

<p><b>How can we create this singleton class?</b></p>
In order to make singleton class, first we have a to make a constructor as private, next we have to create a private static instance of the class and finally we have to provide static method instance so that’s how we can create the singleton class
<p><b>Are these threads safe?</b></p>
Singleton classes are not thread-safe by default. If multiple threads try to create an instance at the same time, it could result in multiple instances. To prevent this, we can synchronize the method that creates the instance or use a static initializer


<p><b>What is a constructor in Java?</b></p>
A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize new objects. It has the same name as the class and may take arguments to set initial values for the object's attributes.

<p><b>Can we use a private constructor?</b></p>
Yes, we can use private constructors in Java. They are mostly used in classes that provide static methods or contain only static fields. A common use is in the Singleton design pattern, where the goal is to limit the class to only one object.

 
<p><b>Can constructor be overloaded?</b></p>
Yes, you can have multiple constructors in a Java class, each with a different set of parameters. This lets you create objects in various ways depending on what information you have at the time.

<p><b>What is immutability mean in Java?</b></p>
Immutability in Java means that once an object's state is created, it cannot be changed.

<p><b>Why immutable objects are useful for concorrent programming?</b></p>
These are useful in concurrent programming because they can be shared between threads without needing synchronization.

<p><b>What are immutable classes?</b></p>
Immutable classes in Java are classes whose objects cannot be modified after they are created. This means all their fields are final and set only once, typically through the constructor.
<p><b>How can we create immutable class?</b></p>
1.	Declare the class as final so it can’t be extended.
2.	Make all of the fields final and private so that direct access is not allowed.
3.	Don’t provide setter methods for variables
4.	Initialize all fields using a constructor method


<p><b>What does Java's inheritance mean?</b></p>
Inheritance in Java means a class can use the features of another class. This helps to reuse code and make things simpler.
<p><b>Can a class extends on its own</b></p>
No, a class in Java cannot extend itself. If it tries, it will cause an error
<p><b>Why multiple inheritance is not possible in java?</b></p>
Java avoids using multiple inheritance because it can make things complicated, such as when two parent classes have methods that conflict.

<p><b>What is the difference between inheritance and composition?</b></p>
Inheritance is when one class gets its features from another class. Composition is when a class is made using parts from other classes, which can be more flexible.
<p><b>Discuss the principle of "composition over inheritance".</b></p>
	Provide an example where this principle should be applied in Java application design.
"Composition over inheritance" means using objects within other objects
(composition) instead of inheriting from a parent class. It’s applied when classes

 
have a "has-a" relationship. For example, a Car class can have an Engine class as a field rather than inheriting from an Engine.
<p><b>What is the difference between association, aggregation, and composition in Java?</b></p>
 Association is a general relationship between two classes. Aggregation is a weak association (has-a) where the child can exist independently of the parent.
Composition is a strong association where the child cannot exist without the parent.

<p><b>Explain the IS-A (inheritance) and Has-A (composition) relationships in Java.</b></p>
IS-A refers to inheritance, where a subclass is a type of the superclass. Has-A refers to composition, where a class contains references to other classes as fields.
<p><b>What does mean by polymorphism in Java?</b></p>
Polymorphism in Java means that the same piece of code can do different things depending on what kind of object it's dealing with. For example, if you have a method called "draw," it might make a circle for a Circle object and a square for a Square object.

<p><b>How does method overloading relate to polymorphism?</b></p>
Method overloading is using the same method name with different inputs in the same class. It's a simple way to use polymorphism when you're writing your code.
<p><b>What is dynamic method dispatch in Java?</b></p>
Dynamic method dispatch is a way Java decides which method to use at runtime when methods are overridden in subclasses. It ensures the correct method is used based on the type of object.

<p><b>Can constructors be polymorphic?</b></p>
No, constructors cannot be polymorphic. We can have many constructors in a class with different inputs, but they don’t behave differently based on the object type like methods do.

<p><b>What does mean by abstraction in java?</b></p>
Abstraction in Java means focusing on what needs to be done, not how to do it. You create a kind of blueprint that tells other parts of the program what actions they can perform without explaining the details.

<p><b>Can you provide examples of where abstraction is effectively used in Java libraries?</b></p>
 Java uses abstraction in its collection tools. For example, when you use a List, you don't need to know how it stores data, whether as an ArrayList or a LinkedList.
<p><b>What happens if a class includes an abstract method?</b></p>
A class with an abstract method must itself be abstract. We can't create objects directly from an abstract class; it's meant to be a blueprint for other classes.
<p><b>How does abstraction help in achieving loose coupling in software applications?</b></p>


 
Abstraction lets us hide complex details and only show what's necessary. This makes it easier to change parts of your program without affecting others, keeping different parts independent and easier to manage.

<p><b>What is interface in Java?</b></p>
interface is like a blueprint for a class. It defines a set of methods that the class must implement, without specifying how these methods should work

<p><b>What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in Java?</b></p>
 abstract class achieves partial abstraction (0 to 100%) whereas interface achieves fully abstraction. Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods
whereas Interface can have only abstract methods. (Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.)
<p><b>Can you provide examples of when to use an interface versus when to extend a class?</b></p>
Use an interface when we want to list the methods a class should have, without detailing how they work. Use class extension when we want a new class to inherit features and behaviors from an existing class and possibly modify them.
<p><b>How do you use multiple inheritance in Java using interfaces?</b></p>
In Java, we can't inherit features from multiple classes directly, but we can use interfaces for a similar effect. A class can follow the guidelines of many interfaces at once, which lets it combine many sets of capabilities.
<p><b>Can an interface in Java contain static methods, and if so, how can they be used?</b></p>
 Yes, interfaces in Java can have static methods, which you can use without creating an instance of the class.

<p><b>When would you use an interface, and when would you use an abstract class?</b></p>
 Use an interface when you need multiple classes to share a contract without implementation. Use an abstract class when you need shared behavior (method implementations) along with method declarations.
<p><b>Explain the difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces. When would you use one over the other?</b></p>
Comparable is used for natural ordering and is implemented by the class itself, while Comparator is used for custom ordering and can be implemented externally. Use Comparable when objects have a single logical ordering; use Comparator when you need multiple ways to order objects.
<p><b>What is a static method in an Interface, and how is it different from a default method in an interface?</b></p>
A static method in an interface belongs to the interface itself and cannot be overridden. A default method provides a default implementation for classes that implement the interface, and it can be overridden.
 
<p><b>What is the diamond problem in Java and how does Java address it?</b></p>
The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance where a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor. Java resolves this by not allowing multiple inheritance with classes, but interfaces can use default methods to avoid this issue.
<p><b>How does the concept of default methods in interfaces help resolve the diamond problem?</b></p>
Default methods allow interfaces to provide method implementations, and in case of conflicts (multiple interfaces with the same default method), the implementing class must override the method, resolving ambiguity.


<p><b>What does mean by encapsulation in java?</b></p>
Encapsulation in Java is like putting important information into a safe. We store data and the methods inside a class, and we control who can access or change the data by using specific methods.
<p><b>How Encapsulation Enhances Software Security and Integrity:</b></p>
Encapsulation keeps important data hidden and safe. It only lets certain parts of our program use this data, which helps prevent mistakes and keeps the data secure from unwanted changes.

<p><b>What is the concept of Serialization in Java?</b></p>
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission. It allows objects to be saved and restored later or transferred over a network.
<p><b>What is the purpose of the serialVersionUID in Java serialization?</b></p>
The serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for Serializable classes. It ensures that the serialized and deserialized objects are compatible by checking version consistency. If the serialVersionUID of the class doesn’t match during deserialization, an InvalidClassException is thrown, preventing incompatible class versions from being used.
<p><b>What happens if the serialVersionUID of a class changes during deserialization?</b></p>
 If the serialVersionUID changes between serialization and deserialization, the JVM considers the class as incompatible with the serialized object. This results in an InvalidClassException, as the runtime expects the version of the serialized class to match with the version defined in the deserialized class.

<p><b>How can you prevent certain fields from being serialized in Java</b></p>
You can prevent specific fields from being serialized by marking them with the transient keyword. When a field is declared as transient, it is excluded from the serialization process, meaning its value will not be saved when the object is serialized.
<p><b>Can a class be serialized if one of its member fields is not serializable?</b></p>

 
A class can still be serialized even if one of its member fields is not serializable. However, you must mark the non-serializable field as transient. If the field is not transient and is not serializable, attempting to serialize the object will result in a NotSerializableException.
<p><b>What is the difference between writeObject() and readObject() methods in Java serialization?</b></p>
The writeObject() and readObject() methods allow customization of the serialization and deserialization processes. writeObject() is used to customize how an object is serialized, while readObject() customizes how it is deserialized. These methods can be overridden to handle complex scenarios, such as serializing transient fields or managing class versioning.

<p><b>Is it possible to serialize static fields in Java? Why or why not?</b></p>
No, static fields are not serialized in Java because they belong to the class, not to individual instances. Serialization is intended to capture the state of an object, and static fields are part of the class's state, not the object's state.
<p><b>How do you serialize an object with circular references in Java?</b></p>
Java handles circular references during serialization by keeping track of references that have already been serialized. When the same object reference appears again, Java writes a reference to the already serialized object rather than serializing it again. This prevents infinite recursion and maintains the object graph structure.


<p><b>What is method overloading in Java?</b></p>
Polymorphism in Java means that the same piece of code can do different things depending on what kind of object it's dealing with. For example, if you have a method called "draw," it might make a circle for a Circle object and a square for a Square object.
<p><b>How does the Java compiler determine which overloaded method to call?</b></p>
When we call an overloaded method, the Java compiler looks at the number and type of arguments you've provided and picks the method that matches these arguments best.
<p><b>Is it possible to overload methods that differ only by their return type in Java?</b></p>
In Java, we cannot overload methods just by changing their return type. The methods must differ by their parameters for overloading to be valid.

<p><b>What are the rules for method overloading in Java?</b></p>
The parameters must differ in how many there are, what type they are, or the order they are in.

<p><b>What is method overriding in Java?</b></p>



 
To override a method, the new method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the parent class. Also, the new method should not be less accessible than the original.
<p><b>What are the rules and conditions for method overriding in Java?</b></p>
In Java, method overriding occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as one in its parent class. The method in the subclass replaces the one in the parent class when called.

<p><b>How does the @Override annotation influence method overriding?</b></p>
The @Override annotation tells the compiler that the method is supposed to replace one from its superclass. It's useful because it helps find mistakes if the method does not actually override an existing method from the parent class.

<p><b>What happens if a superclass method is overridden by more than one subclass in Java?</b></p>
If different subclasses override the same method from a superclass, each subclass will have its own version of that method.
<p><b>What is 'this' and 'super' keyword in java?</b></p>
'this' is used to refer current class's instance as well as static members. 'super' keyword is used to access methods of the parent class.

<p><b>Can 'this' keyword be assigned a new value in Java?</b></p>
No, this keyword cannot be assigned a new value in Java. It is a read-only reference that always points to the current object.
<p><b>What happens if you attempt to use the "super" keyword in a class that doesn't have a superclass?</b></p>
If we attempt to use the "super" keyword in a class that doesn't have a superclass, a compilation error occurs. The "super" keyword is only applicable within subclasses to refer to members of the superclass.
<p><b>Can the this or super keyword be used in a static method?</b></p>
No, the this and super keyword cannot be used in static methods. Static methods belong to the class, not instances, and super refers to the superclass's object context, which does not exist in a static context.
<p><b>How does 'super' play a role in polymorphism ?</b></p>
In Java, the super keyword lets a subclass use methods from its parent class, helping it behave in different ways and that is nothing but a polymorphic behavior


<p><b>What is the static keyword in Java?</b></p>
The static keyword in Java is used to indicate that a particular member (variable or method) belongs to the class, rather than any instance of the class. This means that the static member can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

 
<p><b>Can a static block throw an exception?</b></p>
Yes, a static block can throw an exception, but if it does, the exception must be handled within the block itself or declared using a throws clause in the class.
<p><b>Can we override static methods in Java?</b></p>
No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at runtime and static methods are bound at compile time.

<p><b>Is it possible to access non-static members from within a static method?</b></p>
No, it's not possible to access non-static members (instance variables or methods) directly from within a static method. This is because static methods belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance. To access non-static members, you need to create an instance of the class and use that object to reference the non-static members.
<p><b>What is static block?</b></p>
To initialize static variables, the statements inside static block are executed only once, when the class is loaded in the memory.

<p><b>Can we print something on console without main method in java?</b></p>
Prior to Java 8, yes, we can print something without main method buts its not possible from java 8 onwards

<p><b>What is final keyword in java?</b></p>
the 'final' keyword is used to declare constants, making variables unchangeable once assigned, or to prevent method overriding or class inheritance
<p><b>What are some common use cases for using final variables in Java programming?</b></p>
 Common use cases for using final variables in Java programming include defining constants, parameters passed to methods, and local variables in lambdas or anonymous inner classes.
<p><b>How does the "final" keyword contribute to immutability and thread safety in Java?</b></p>
The "final" keyword contributes to immutability and thread safety in Java by ensuring that the value of a variable cannot be changed once assigned, preventing unintended modifications and potential concurrency issues.

<p><b>Can you describe any performance considerations related to using final?</b></p>
The final keyword improves the performance by reducing call overhead?

<p><b>What is functional interfaces?</b></p>



 
Functional interfaces in Java are interfaces with just one abstract method. They are used to create lambda expressions and instances of these interfaces can be created with lambdas, method references, or constructor references.
<p><b>Can functional interface extend another interface?</b></p>
No, as functional interface allows to have only single abstract method. However functional interface can inherit another interface if it contains only static and default methods in it

<p><b>Advantages of using a functional interface.</b></p>
Functional interfaces, which contain only one abstract method, are key to enabling functional programming in Java. They offer concise and readable code through lambda expressions and method references, improving code simplicity. Functional interfaces allow easy parallel processing, better abstraction, and reusability, especially in scenarios like streams and event handling, promoting a cleaner and more expressive programming style.


</b></p>Java 8 Basics</b></p>
<p><b>Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 8?</b></p>
Lambda Expressions, Stream API, Method References , Default Methods , Optional Class, New Date-Time API are the new features that were introduced in java 8

<p><b>Why optional class, lambda expressions and stream API were introduced in java 8?</b></p>
 Optional class was introduced in Java 8 as a way to address the problem of null references
Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 to make it easier to write code for interfaces that have only one method, using a simpler and more direct style.
The Stream API was introduced in Java 8 to help developers process collections of data in a more straightforward and efficient way, especially for bulk operations like filtering or sorting.
<p><b>Difference between filter and map function of stream API?</b></p>
filter() eliminates elements of collection where the condition is not satisfied whereas map() is used to perform operation on all elements hence, it returns all elements of collection

<p><b>Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 11?</b></p>
HTTP Client, Epsilon Garbage Collector, Z Garbage Collector, Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters are some of the new features and along with these new features, isBlank(), strip(), stripLeading(), stripTrailing(), and repeat() were also introduced for strings
<p><b>Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 17?</b></p>
Sealed Classes, Pattern Matching for switch, Foreign Function and Memory API are some of the examples
 
<p><b>Can you tell me some new features that were introduced in Java 21?</b></p>
Virtual Threads, Structured Concurrency, Scoped Values, Sequenced Collections, Record Pattern are some of the examples
<p><b>Which is faster, traditional for loop or Streams?</b></p>
Traditional for loops are generally faster due to less overhead, but Streams provide better readability and are optimized for parallel processing in large datasets.

<p><b>In which scenarios would you prefer traditional for loops and streams?</b></p>
Use traditional loops for simple, small datasets requiring maximum performance. Use Streams for more complex data transformations or when working with large datasets where readability, maintainability, and potential parallelism are prioritized.

<p><b>Explain intermediate and terminal operations in streams.</b></p>
Intermediate operations (e.g., filter(), map()) return another stream and are lazy (executed only when a terminal operation is called). Terminal operations (e.g., forEach(), collect()) trigger the actual processing of the stream and produce a result or side effect.
<p><b>Differences in Interface from Java 7 to Java 8.</b></p>
In Java 7, interfaces could only have abstract methods. Java 8 introduced default and static methods, allowing interfaces to have method implementations.
<p><b>Use of String.join(….) in Java 8?</b></p>
String.join() concatenates a sequence of strings with a specified delimiter, simplifying string joining operations.


<p><b>Collection Framework</b></p>
<p><b>What is collection framework in java?</b></p>
The Java Collection Framework is a set of tools that helps us organize, store, and manage groups of data easily. It includes various types of collections like lists, sets, and maps.
<p><b>What are the main interfaces of the Java Collection Framework?</b></p>
The main parts of the Java Collection Framework are interfaces like Collection, List, Set, Queue, and Map. Each one helps manage data in different ways.
<p><b>Can you explain how Iterator works within the Java Collection Framework?</b></p>
An Iterator is a tool in the Collection Framework that lets you go through a collection's elements one by one.
<p><b>What are some common methods available in all Collection types?</b></p>
Some common methods all collection types have are add, remove, clear, size, and isEmpty. These methods let us add and remove items, check the size, and see if the collection is empty.
 
<p><b>How does Java Collection Framework handle concurrency?</b></p>
The Collection Framework deals with multiple threads using special collection classes like ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList, which let different parts of our program modify the collection at the same time safely.
<p><b>How do you choose the right collection type for a specific problem?</b></p>
To pick the right collection type, think about what we need: List if you want an ordered collection that can include duplicates, Set if you need unique elements, Queue for processing elements in order, and Map for storing pairs of keys and values.

<p><b>What enhancements were made to the Java Collection Framework in Java 8?</b></p>
Java 8 made improvements to the Collection Framework by adding Streams, which make it easier to handle collections in bulk, and lambda expressions, which simplify writing code for operations on collections.
<p><b>What is the difference between Iterator and listIterator?</b></p>
Iterator allows forward traversal of a collection, while ListIterator extends Iterator functionality to allow bidirectional traversal of lists and also supports element modification.

<p><b>Name of algorithm used by Arrays.sort(..) and Collections.sort(..)?</b></p>
Arrays.sort() uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm for primitive types and TimSort for object arrays. Collections.sort() uses TimSort, a hybrid sorting algorithm combining merge sort and insertion sort.
<p><b>How do you store elements in a set to preserve insertion order?</b></p>
Use a LinkedHashSet, which preserves the insertion order of elements.

<p><b>How do you store elements in a way that they are sorted?</b></p>
Use a TreeSet or a TreeMap, which automatically sorts elements based on their natural ordering or a specified comparator.

<p><b>Whats the use case of arrayList, linkedList and Hashset?</b></p>
We use arrayList where we need efficient random access to elements via indices, like retrieving elements frequently from a list without altering it.

We use LinkedList where you frequently add and remove elements from the beginning or middle of the list, such as implementing queues or stacks.

We use HashSet where we need to ensure that there are no duplicates and we require fast lookups, additions, and deletions. It is ideal for scenarios like checking membership existence, such as in a set of unique items or keys.
<p><b>How does a HashSet ensure that there are no duplicates?</b></p>

 
A HashSet in Java uses a HashMap under the hood. Each element you add is treated as a key in this HashMap. Since keys in a HashMap are unique, HashSet automatically prevents any duplicate entries.
<p><b>Can you describe how hashCode() and equals() work together in a collection</b></p>
 hashCode() determines which bucket an object goes into, while equals() checks equality between objects in the same bucket to handle collisions, ensuring that each key is unique.

<p><b>Why is it important to override the hashCode method when you override equals?</b></p>
What would be the consequence if we don’t?
Overriding hashCode() is crucial because hash-based collections like HashMap and HashSet use the hashcode to locate objects. Without consistent hashCode() and equals(), objects may not be found or stored correctly.
<p><b>Can you give an example where a TreeSet is more appropriate than HashSet?</b></p>
 A TreeSet is more appropriate than a HashSet when you need to maintain the elements in a sorted order. For example, if we are managing a list of customer names that must be displayed alphabetically, using a TreeSet would be ideal.
<p><b>What is the internal implementation of ArrayList and LinkedList?</b></p>
ArrayList is backed by a dynamic array, which provides O(1) access time but requires resizing. LinkedList is implemented as a doubly-linked list, providing O(1) insertion and deletion at both ends but O(n) access time.


<p><b>Can you explain internal working of HashMap in Java?</b></p>
A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs in an array where each element is a bucket. It uses a hash function to determine which bucket a key should go into for efficient data retrieval. If two keys end up in the same bucket, a Collison happened then the HashMap manages these collisions by maintaining a linked list or a balanced tree depend upon the java version in each bucket.
<p><b>What happens when two keys have the same hash code? How would you handle this scenario?</b></p>
When two different Java objects have the same hashcode, it's called a hash collision. In this case, Java handles it by storing both objects in the same bucket in a hash- based collection, like a HashMap. It then compares the objects using the equals() method to differentiate them.

<p><b>How does a HashMap handle collisions in Java?</b></p>
In Java, when a HashMap encounters a collision (two keys with the same hashcode), it stores both entries in the same bucket. Prior to Java 8, it linked them in a simple list structure. In Java 8, if the number of entries in a bucket grows large, the list is converted to a balanced tree for faster lookups.



 
<p><b>Can you please tell me what changes were done for the HashMap in Java 8 because before java 8 hashMap behaved differently ?</b></p>
Before Java 8, HashMap dealt with collisions by using a simple linked list. Starting from Java 8, when too many items end up in the same bucket, the list turns into a balanced tree, which helps speed up searching.
<p><b>Can we include class as a key in hashmap?</b></p>
No, as functional interface allows to have only single abstract method. However functional interface can inherit another interface if it contains only static and default methods in it

<p><b>Can you please explain ConcurrentHashMap</b></p>
ConcurrentHashMap is a version of HashMap that's safe to use by many threads at once without needing to lock the entire map. It divides the map into parts that can be locked separately, allowing better performance.
<p><b>How does it(ConcurrentHashMap ) improve performance in a multi-threaded environment?</b></p>
ConcurrentHashMap boosts performance in multi-threaded settings by letting different threads access and modify different parts of the map simultaneously, reducing waiting times and improving efficiency.

<p><b>What is time complexities insertions, deletion and retrieval of hashSet and HashMap?</b></p>
1.	Insertion:
2.	Average: O(1)
3.	Worst case: O(n) when rehashing occurs
4.	Deletion:
5.	Average: O(1)
6.	Worst case: O(n) when rehashing occurs
7.	Retrieval:
8.	Average: O(1)
9.	Worst case: O(n) when rehashing occurs (due to hash collisions) NOTE: HashSet and HashMap are not internally sorted
<p><b>What is time complexities insertions, deletion and retrieval of TreeSet and TreeMap?</b></p>
O(log n) for operations like insertions, deletion and retrieval NOTE: HashSet and HashMap are not internally sorted
<p><b>What techniques did hashMap, treeMap, hashSet and TreeSet uses internally for performing operations?</b></p>
HashMap uses an array of nodes, where each node is a linked list or Tree depend upon the collisions and java versions ( From Java 8 onwards, if there is high hash collisons then linkedList gets converted to Balanced Tree).
TreeMap uses a Red-Black tree, which is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node in the Red-Black tree stores a key-value pair.
HashSet internally uses a HashMap whereas TreeSet internally uses TreeMap

<p><b>Design Patterns and Principles Basics</b></p>

<p><b>What is a design pattern in Java and why do we use this?</b></p>
Design patterns are proven solutions for common software design problems. They provide standardized approaches to organize code in a way that is maintainable, scalable, and understandable.

<p><b>Can you list and explain a few common design patterns used in Java programming?</b></p>
Common design patterns in Java:
1.	Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance, with a global access point.
2.	Observer: Allows objects to notify others about changes in their state.
3.	Factory Method: Delegates the creation of objects to subclasses, promoting flexibility.
<p><b>How can design patterns affect the performance of a Java application?</b></p>
Design patterns can impact performance by adding complexity, but they improve system architecture and maintainability. The long-term benefits often outweigh the initial performance cost.
<p><b>Which design pattern would you use to manage database connections efficiently in a Java application?</b></p>
The Singleton pattern is commonly used to manage database connections, ensuring a single shared connection instance is reused efficiently.
<p><b>How do you choose the appropriate design pattern for a particular problem in Java?</b></p>
Understand the problem fully, identify similar problems solved by design patterns, and consider the implications of each pattern on the application’s design and performance.

<p><b>Difference between HashMap and TreeMap.</b></p>
HashMap stores key-value pairs without ordering, while TreeMap sorts the entries by keys. TreeMap has O(log n) operations due to its tree structure, whereas HashMap has O(1) operations under ideal conditions.
<p><b>In what scenarios would you prefer to use a TreeMap over a HashMap?</b></p>
Use a TreeMap when you need to maintain a sorted order of keys, such as when iterating over sorted data. A HashMap is preferable for fast lookups without concern for ordering.
<p><b>Can we add objects as a key in TreeMap?</b></p>
 
Yes, objects can be used as keys in a TreeMap if they implement the Comparable interface or a Comparator is provided for sorting the keys.

<p><b>What are SOLID Principles?</b></p>

'S' stands for Single Responsibility Principle: It means a class should only have one reason to change, meaning it should handle just one part of the functionality.
For Example: A class VehicleRegistration should only handle vehicle registration details. If it also takes care of vehicle insurance, then it will violates this.
'O' stands for Open/Closed Principle: It means Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
For Example: We have a VehicleService class that provides maintenance services. Later, we need to add a new service type for electric vehicles and if without modifying VehicleService, we are able to extend it from a subclass ElectricVehicleService then it follows this priciple. 'L' stands for Liskov Substitution Principle: It means Objects of a superclass should be
replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the program’s correctness.
For Example: If we have a superclass Vehicle with a method startEngine(), and subclasses like Car and ElectricCar, we should be able to replace Vehicle with Car or ElectricCar in our system without any functionality breaking. If ElectricCar can't implement startEngine() because it doesn’t have a traditional engine, it should still work with the interface to not break the system.
'I' for Interface Segregation Principle: It means do not force any client to depend on methods it does not use; split large interfaces into smaller ones.
For Example: Instead of one large interface VehicleOperations with methods like drive, refuel, charge, and navigate, split it into focused interfaces like Drivable, Refuelable, and Navigable. An ElectricCar wouldn't need to implement Refuelable, just Chargeable and Navigable.
'D' stands for Dependency Inversion Principle: It means High-level modules should not depend directly on low-level modules but should communicate through abstractions like interfaces.
For Example: If a VehicleTracker class needs to log vehicle positions, it shouldn't depend directly on a specific GPS device model. Instead, it should interact through a GPSDevice interface, allowing any GPS device that implements this interface to be used without changing the VehicleTracker class.


<b><p>Concurrency and multi-threading</b></p>
<p><b>What is a thread in Java and how can we create it?</b></p>
A thread in Java is a pathway of execution within a program. You can create a thread by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.
<p><b>Can you explain the lifecycle of a Java thread?</b></p>
A Java thread lifecycle includes states: New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed Waiting, and Terminated.

 
<p><b>How would you handle a scenario where two threads need to update the same data structure?</b></p>
Use synchronized blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can access the data structure at a time, preventing concurrent modification issues.
<p><b>Can we strat thread twice?</b></p>
No, a thread in Java cannot be started more than once. Attempting to restart a thread that has already run will throw an IllegalThreadStateException.

<p><b>What is the difference between Thread class and Runnable interface in Java?</b></p>
The Thread class defines a thread of execution, whereas the Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.

<p><b>How can you ensure a method is thread-safe in Java?</b></p>
To ensure thread safety, use synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks, volatile variables, or concurrent data structures.
<p><b>What are volatile variables?</b></p>
Volatile variables in Java are used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by different threads, ensuring that the value read is always the latest written.

<p><b>What is thread synchronization and why is it important?</b></p>
Thread synchronization controls the access of multiple threads to shared resources to prevent data inconsistency and ensure thread safety.
<p><b>Can you describe a scenario where you would use wait() and notify() methods in thread communication?</b></p>
Use wait() and notify() for inter-thread communication, like when one thread needs to wait for another to complete a task before proceeding.
<p><b>What challenges might you face with multithreaded programs in Java?</b></p>
In Java, multithreaded programming can lead to issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and resource contention, which complicate debugging and affect performance. Managing thread safety and synchronization efficiently is also a significant challenge.

<p><b>What is Java memory model and how it is linked to threads?</b></p>
The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines the rules by which Java programs achieve consistency when reading and writing variables across multiple threads, ensuring all threads have a consistent view of memory.



</b></p>Miscellaneous questions (Not too much important)</b></p>


 
<p><b>what is transient?</b></p>
The transient keyword in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be serialized. This means it will be ignored when objects are serialized and deserialized.

<p><b>Can we create a server in java application without creating spring or any other framework?</b></p>
Yes, you can create a server in a Java application using only Java SE APIs, such as by utilizing the ServerSocket class for a simple TCP server or the HttpServer class for HTTP services.


<p><b>What is exchanger class</b></p>
The Exchanger class in Java is a synchronization point at which threads can pair and swap elements within pairs. Each thread presents some object on exchange and receives another object in return from another thread.
<p><b>What is reflection in java?</b></p>
Reflection in Java is a capability to inspect and modify the runtime behavior of applications. It allows programs to manipulate internal properties of classes, methods, interfaces, and dynamically call them at runtime.
<p><b>What is the weak reference and soft reference in java?</b></p>
Weak references in Java are garbage collected when no strong references exist. Soft references are only cleared at the discretion of the garbage collector, typically when memory is low.

<p><b>What is Java Flight Recorder?</b></p>
Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a tool for collecting diagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application without significant performance overhead.
<p><b>Discuss Java Generics.</b></p>
Generics provide type safety by allowing classes and methods to operate on objects of specific types, preventing runtime ClassCastException and reducing code duplication
<p><b>What is the difference between Young Generation and Old Generation memory spaces?</b></p>
The Young Generation stores newly created objects. The Old Generationholds objects that have survived several garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation
