 Java 8 Features & Functional Programming

What are Lambda Expressions in Java 8?
“A Lambda Expression in Java 8 is basically an anonymous function — it has no name, return type, or access modifier. It’s mainly used to represent the implementation of a functional interface in a concise way.

Explain the Stream API in Java 8.
“The Stream API in Java 8 is one of the most powerful features that allows us to process collections in a functional and declarative way.
Instead of using loops, we can perform operations like filtering, mapping, sorting, and collecting in a pipeline manner.

What is a Functional Interface? Provide an example.
Functional interfaces in Java are interfaces with just one abstract method. They are used to 
create lambda expressions and instances of these interfaces can be created with lambdas, 
method references, or constructor references. 

How does the default keyword work in interfaces?
“In Java 8, the default keyword lets us write method implementations inside interfaces.
It mainly provides backward compatibility — so old classes don’t break when new methods are added to interfaces.
Classes can use or override default methods, and if two interfaces have the same one, the class must resolve it explicitly.”

What is the CompletableFuture class in Java 8?
“CompletableFuture in Java 8 is an enhanced version of the Future interface that supports asynchronous, non-blocking programming.
Unlike traditional Future, it allows us to attach callbacks and chain multiple operations using methods like thenApply(), thenAccept(), and thenRun().

Explain the Optional class and its use cases.
“The Optional class in Java 8 is a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value.
It was introduced to reduce the chances of NullPointerException and make our code more readable and safe.
In real-world applications, Optional is very useful for handling database or API responses that might return null values.

What is the Method Reference feature in Java 8?
“Method Reference in Java 8 is a shorthand notation of Lambda Expressions that lets us directly refer to an existing method or constructor using the :: operator.

How does the DateTime API in Java 8 improve date and time handling?
“In Java 8, the new Date-Time API under the java.time package completely restructured how we handle dates and times.
The old Date and Calendar classes were mutable, confusing, and not thread-safe. The new API fixes all that — it’s immutable, thread-safe, and far more readable

1️⃣ Lambda Expressions

“Lambda Expressions in Java 8 allow us to write anonymous methods in a concise way. They implement functional interfaces and enable functional-style programming.
Example: Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello Lambda"); new Thread(r).start();
Lambdas reduce boilerplate and improve code readability.”

2️⃣ Functional Interface

“A Functional Interface has exactly one abstract method and can have default or static methods. They serve as the target type for Lambda Expressions.
Example:

@FunctionalInterface
interface Greeting { void sayHello(); }
Greeting g = () -> System.out.println("Hello"); g.sayHello();
```”

3️⃣ Stream API

“Stream API allows functional-style processing of collections. It supports filtering, mapping, and reducing operations and can be sequential or parallel.
Example: list.stream().filter(n -> n % 2 == 0).forEach(System.out::println);
This makes data processing concise and readable.”

4️⃣ Optional Class

“Optional is a container that may or may not hold a value. It helps avoid NullPointerExceptions and encourages explicit handling of absent values.
Example: Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null); System.out.println(name.orElse("Default"));”

5️⃣ Default & Static Methods in Interfaces

“Java 8 allows default and static methods in interfaces. Default methods provide implementation so interfaces can evolve without breaking existing code.
Example:

interface Vehicle { default void start() { System.out.println("Starting"); } }
class Car implements Vehicle {}
new Car().start(); // prints 'Starting'
```”

6️⃣ Method References

“Method Reference is a shorthand of Lambda Expressions that refers to an existing method using ::.
Example: list.forEach(System.out::println);
Types include static, instance, and constructor references. It improves readability.”

7️⃣ Date-Time API

“Java 8’s Date-Time API (java.time) replaces old Date and Calendar classes. It’s immutable, thread-safe, and separates date, time, and timezone.
Example: LocalDate today = LocalDate.now(); LocalDate nextWeek = today.plusWeeks(1);
It also provides formatting, parsing, and time-zone support.”

8️⃣ CompletableFuture

“CompletableFuture is an enhanced Future that supports asynchronous, non-blocking programming. It allows chaining tasks, handling exceptions, and combining multiple futures.
Example:

CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 'Hello')
    .thenApply(s -> s + ' Java')
    .thenAccept(System.out::println);


It simplifies parallel and async coding.”
